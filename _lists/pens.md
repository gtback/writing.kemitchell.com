## Disposable Pens

### Travel

Uni-Ball Vision Elite (Rollerball)

- Writes like other cone-point rollerballs.
- Won't leak on airplanes.

### Fine Line

Uni-Ball Signo RT (Gel)

- Consistent fine point.
- Compact.
- Widely available at bix-box office stores.

Pilot Hi-Tec-C (Gel)

- Not widely available in the US, but plentiful online.
- Point sizes down to 0.25mm.
- Many colors.

### Desk Needle Points

Pilot V5 (Rollerball)

Sharpie Needle Point (Rollberball)

Uni-Ball Vision Needle (Rollerball)

### Upright Hands

Some writers, right- and left-handed, hold their pens almost straight up, perpendicular to the page.

### Retractable

Pilot G2 (Gel)

- The 0.38mm is defective.  Feed wires get jammed up against, and then protrude past, rollerballs.
- Plastic pocket clips tend to snap off.  The Pro and especially Limited versions improve on this.

Pilot Precise V5 and V7 RT

- Metal pocket clips last.

## Refillable and Cartridge Pens

### Rollerball

Retro 51 Tornado

- The cartridges are good.
- The twist mechanism is handy.

Lamy 2000 Rollerball

- Lamy sells only medium cartridges, but Schmidt, the OEM supplier, makes fine ones.

## Fountain Pens

Fountain pens are wonderful to write with, and highly inconvenient, compared to modern rollerball and gel pens.  You will get ink on your fingers.

### Step 1

Dip a toe in with some Pilot Varsity disposables.  They're widely available, even at big-box retail stores, and will give you a good idea of whether a fountain pen fits in your life.

### Step 2

If you empty out a Varsity or two, and want more, consider a high-value, entry-level pen.
