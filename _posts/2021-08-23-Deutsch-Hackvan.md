[This archived 1998 interview of L. Peter Deutsch by Stig Hackvän](https://web.archive.org/web/20041013082602/http://devlinux.org/deutsch-interview.html) will be worthwhile for anyone interested in free software, the software business, dual licensing, and the deeper tensions of cooperation and competition under intellectual property law.  It crystallizes, in remarkably plain terms, a number of points that I sorely wish I'd been ready to receive way back then.

[L. Peter Deutsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Peter_Deutsch) created [Ghostscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostscript), the Postscript and PDF processor, as well as [Artifex](https://artifex.com/), the company that continues to develop and dual-license it to this day.  He arguably invented free software dual licensing.

Regular readers will recognize the Artifex name from the styles of several lawsuits enforcing the copyleft conditions of GPL licenses.
