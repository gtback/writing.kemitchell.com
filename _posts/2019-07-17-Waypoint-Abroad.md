brief: I'm seeking quick reads from non-US, common-law counsel for a new, international version of the Waypoint NDA.

The [Waypoint Nondisclosure Agreement](https://waypointnda.com), the standard business nondisclosure agreement, is approaching version 2.0.0.  The biggest goal for 2.0.0 is to support more common-law jurisdictions besides the USA and Canada, for which it's already been proofed.

If you know good contract counsel who reads English and holds a license to practice law in another common-law country, I'd greatly appreciate a quick review informal word from them that the terms will function correctly under their law.  You can send them a link to [the current review draft](https://waypointnda.com/files/waypoint-nda-2.0.0-pre.2.pdf) and copy me on an e-mail at [kyle@kemitchell.com](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com).

We are focusing initially on the largest common-law economies, where an NDA like Waypoint is likely to see most use:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>United Kingdom</li>
        <li>India</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Australia</li>
        <li>Israel</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Hong Kong</li>
        <li>Singapore</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>New Zealand</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

However, we'd enthusiastically welcome word on whether the form works, or what changes would help to make it work, for any common-law jurisdiction:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Antigua and Barbuda</li>
        <li>Bahamas</li>
        <li>Bangldesh</li>
        <li>Barbados</li>
        <li>Belize</li>
        <li>Bhutan</li>
        <li>British Virgin Islands</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Cayman Islands</li>
        <li>Cyprus</li>
        <li>Dominica</li>
        <li>Fiji</li>
        <li>Ghana</li>
        <li>Gibraltar</li>
        <li>Grenada</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Ireland</li>
        <li>Jamaica</li>
        <li>Kiribati</li>
        <li>Liberia</li>
        <li>Marshall Islands</li>
        <li>Myanmar</li>
        <li>Nauru</li>
        <li>Nepal</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>Palau</li>
        <li>Saint Kitts and Nevis</li>
        <li>Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</li>
        <li>Tonga</li>
        <li>Trinidad and Tobago</li>
        <li>Tuvalu</li>
        <li>Uganda</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Waypoint has seen amazing feedback, use, and adoption over the past few months.  I'm convinced, more than ever, that this is a method of standardization that can achieve real progress in deals law.
