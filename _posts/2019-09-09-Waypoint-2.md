I'm pleased to announce the release of version 2.0.0 of [The Waypoint NDA](https://waypointnda.com), the standard business nondisclosure agreement.  The PDF is [here](https://waypointnda.com/files/waypoint-nda-2.0.0.pdf).

Major improvements in 2.0.0 include blanks to optionally specify forum for disputes and contract term, as well as tweaks to make the form compatible with Canadian and UK governing law.  Waypoint 1.0.0 was a US-only form.  Waypoint 2.0.0 is an increasingly international standard, spanning a growing roster of common-law jurisdictions.

Waypoint is actively seeking private comments from lawyers qualified under Indian, Australian, Israeli, Hong Kong, and New Zealand law, to learn what changes may be necessary or desirable for use in those countries.  If you are or know such a lawyer, please reach out to me at <kyle@kemitchell.com>.
