I've just published second editions of the [Square One forms](https://squareoneforms.com) for hiring employees and contractors in the United States.  The second editions incorporate tons of improvements and fixes, as well as some really excellent feedback from colleagues.

For a sense of the style and substance, have a look at the [Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Terms](https://squareoneforms.com/confidentiality-ip/2e), which work for both [employees](https://squareoneforms.com/employee/2e) and [contractors](https://squareoneforms.com/contractor/2e).  Of course, the project still provides templates for [offer letters](https://squareoneforms.com/offer-letter/2e.rtf) and [statements of work](https://squareoneforms.com/statement-of-work/2e.rtf) to match.
