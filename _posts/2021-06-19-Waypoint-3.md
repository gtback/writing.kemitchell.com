I'm pleased to announce the release of version 3.0.0 of [The Waypoint NDA](https://waypointnda.com), the standard two-way business nondisclosure agreement.  The new version is even more refined and even more welcoming to new users.

Waypoint 3 brings very few changes to the [legal terms](https://waypointnda.com/3.0.0) themselves---just a couple of typo fixes.  The real improvements come in presentation and handling, based on experience proposing and signing the form over the past few years.  Many of these improvements saw light first in [The Guestbook NDA](https://guestbooknda.com), Waypoint's one-way cousin.

We've promoted the "short form" version of Waypoint 2, which incorporates the legal terms by reference, over the "long form", which attaches a copy, for several months now.  But that involved some awkward [jugaad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad), substituting the document incorporating by reference for the "standard form certificate" guaranteeing authenticity of a copy.  Version 3 removes all explicit mention of any "standard form certificate", while still taking purpose, governing law, forum for disputes, and term from the incorporating document.

So the first page of the new short form of Waypoint 3 starts:

> # Standard Nondisclosure Agreement
>
> The parties agree to the terms of the The Waypoint NDA Version 3.0.0 published at waypointnda.com.
>
> **Purpose**: [blank with instructions]
>
> **Governing Law**: [blank with instructions]
>
> **Forum for Disputes**: [blank with instructions]
>
> **Term**: [blank with instructions]
>
> [Signature pages follow.]

The long-form version still starts with a certificate that the terms are as published online, but it's no longer titled "standard form certificate":

> # Standard Nondisclosure Agreement
>
> I propose that we sign a standard nondisclosure agreement on the following terms, which I certify are exactly the same as The Waypoint NDA Version 3.0.0 published at waypointnda.com
>
> [signature block for person proposing]
>
> **Purpose**: [blank with instructions]
>
> **Governing Law**: [blank with instructions]
>
> **Forum for Disputes**: [blank with instructions]
>
> **Term**: [blank with instructions]

In either case, those on receiving end see a lot less that's new, usual, or begging explanation.  What is this?  It's a standard NDA!

I continue to enjoy e-mails from new users, especially new users in Canada, Australia, and the UK.  I'm aware of at least a handful of Waypoint NDAs signed _between companies based outside the US_.  Of course, I continue to be very happy with all the time Waypoint saves me and my clients, at home and abroad.
