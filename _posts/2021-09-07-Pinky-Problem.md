I discovered sometime back that I'd almost completely stopped typing the letter _p_ with my little finger.  I was shifting my right hand to press with my ring finger, sometimes even my middle finger.

Discovering this came as a bit of a shock.  I've touch-typed pretty much as long as I've typed.  I was fortunate enough to go to a school that started us early, using [Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavis_Beacon_Teaches_Typing) on some kind of Apple, in something like the second or third grade.  I know I typed _p_ with my little finger back then.  Sometime during the intervening decades, that stopped being true.

In some cases, typing _p_ with bigger fingers seems adaptive.  There are words without _p_ that I've grown accustomed to typing with hands shifted, for speed.  But I've clearly also started shifting my right toward the Enter key when it would be faster to leave it in home position.  Especially to set up the next word in the sentence.

I can't tell exactly why my technique changed, in part because I can't tell when it changed, only when I noticed that it had changed.  I _suspect_ that using mechanical keyboards with stiffer than usual springs---my longtime go-to [Vortexgear](http://vortexgear.tw/) Poker has [Cherry MX-brand "clear" switches](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-clear.html)---may have contributed.  I've since switched back to a keyboard with the softer [brown-stemmed switches](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-brown.html) and committed to intentional, remedial practice.  Going back to the clear-switch board now, I find it noticeably more difficult to type _p_ with my little finger.  It's a weak finger in an awkward position against a stiff spring.

As a side note, [this interesting study](https://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/how-we-type/) of typists' movement strategies identified a common right-hand strategy the researchers called "'lapsed' touch typist", where the little finger continues to press right-side Shift, the middle finger takes over _p_, and the middle finger sometimes types _o_ and _i_, as well.  I found the top-level takeaway from that study---that typing with five fingers can be as fast as typing with ten---a bit disingenuous.  None of the typists studied reached speeds that I'd call "fast".  But I still think the study worth reading, if only because there are so few like it, and the authors dutifully survey the prior literature.
