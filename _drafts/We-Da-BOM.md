title: We Da BOM

> One thing that did happen during the sixties is that some music of an unusual or experimental nature did get recorded, and it did get released.  Now look at who the executives were in those companies at those times.  Not hip, young guys.  These were cigar-chomping old guys, who looked at the product that came and said, "I dunno!  Who knows what it is?  Record it!  Stick it out!  If it sells, alright..."  We were better off with those guys than we are now with the supposedly hip, young executives, you know, who are making the decisions of what people should see and hear in the marketplace.  The young guys are more conservative and more dangerous to the art form than the old guys with the cigars ever were.
>
> And you know how these young guys got in there?  The old with a cigar one day goes, "Ah, well, I took a chance.  It went out and we sold a few million units.  Alright.  I dunno.  I dunno what it is.  But we gotta do more of it.  I need some advice.  Let's get a hippie in here."

> So they hire a hippie.  They bring in a guy with the long hair.

> Now they're not gonna trust him to do anything except carry coffee and bring the mail in and out.  He starts in there.  He's carried the coffee.  "Well, we can trust him.  He brought the coffee four times on time.  Let's give him a real job."
>
> OK.  He becomes an A&R man.  From there, you know, moving up and up.  Next thing you know, he's got his feet on the desk, and he's saying, "well, we can't take a chance on this, because it's just, simply, not what the kids really want!  And I know!"
>
> You know.  And they've got that attitude.  And the day you get rid of the attitude and get back to "Who knows?! Take a chance!", you know, that entrepreneurial spirit where even if you don't like or understand what the record is that's coming in the door, the person who is in the executive chair may not be the final arbiter of taste of the entire population.  You know?
