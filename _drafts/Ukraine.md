Give to the [UN Refugee Agency](https://www.unhcr.org/).  Give to [Разом](https://razomforukraine.org/).  Give to [the Ukrainian armed forces](https://bank.gov.ua/en/news/all/natsionalniy-bank-vidkriv-spetsrahunok-dlya-zboru-koshtiv-na-potrebi-armiyi) if your conscience allows.  Find whatever credible, focused charity site makes you feel good enough to type the numbers and press the damn button.

Tweets, posts, little black squares, video confessions, and definitely this blog post---they are worth nothing to those in need right now.  Unless they lead us to action that helps.  "I am against the war on Ukraine."  How?  What do you _do_ against the war or its consequences?  The UN [has the symbolic front covered](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/03/1113152).  Opposing a war is not a sticker we get to give ourselves on the Internet.  Participation _costs_.

I fell in love with Russia as a boy.  I love Russia, somehow, even today---the language, people, culture, history.  I have longed for Moscow, to live there again, to work there, to meet at Кофе Хауз, to browse at Библио-Глобус, every day since I left.  This war breaks my heart.  I've given so much of myself for so long, for the chance to relate to a people, to a culture.  So [Ходорковский](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Khodorkovsky) of all people could [make me cry](https://youtu.be/tAy5fhKnLyo?t=342)?  [Twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAy5fhKnLyo&t=1704s)?

I've never wanted to hurt a Russian in my life.  I'd rather have liters of [тройка](https://eng.baltika.ru/products/baltika/baltika-3-classic/) or like seven cups of [Акбар](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar_Tea) with almost any Russian in boots currently standing in the wrong fucking country.  I never had a reason to stop and ask which "Russian" friends were Ukrainian until this new invasion.  But you bet your eyes I donated real money for Ukraine.  When I figure out my taxes, I bet I'm good for more.

I became an "open source lawyer" by mistake.  That was not the plan.  The plan was to forge, serve, and spread solid links between my people, tech people, in the former Soviet Union and the United States.

Among my kind of people.  Advancing computing.  For the world.

I went to law school because that was the relevant job I saw Americans I liked doing in Moscow.  Bad things had already started happening.  [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War) when I was in-country.  Then [Крым and Донбасс](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War) at the critical point in my career.  Sanctions went up.  I hunkered down.  Gave my notice at the big law firm, with the big Moscow office, in 2014.  I bided my time.  I held out hope.  Despite  [Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_the_Syrian_civil_war).  Despite [Belarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Belarusian_protests).  But now this.

I was wrong.  For the foreseeable future, my dream is now a fantasy.  The last shreds of plausibility were bombed out of it last week, along with so much of infinitely greater value.

I will find a way to make myself a factor, to make good on the education, the time, the opportunities I have been given.  <mark>I am actively hunting opportunities to bring more related to the Ukrainian diaspora, and Russians settled abroad, into my law practice.</mark>  And I am a pretty good hunter.  But if you, dear reader, see a way, please [send an e-mail](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com).

Keep your loved ones close.  Keep your conscience awake.  In the war on war, Ukraine is the front line.  Her people will fight, persevere in ways that amaze us.  But what they have to work with lies in our hands now.
