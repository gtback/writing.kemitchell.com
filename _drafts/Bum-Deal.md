You can look at the relationship between society and business lawyers as a kind of grand bargain.  Lawyers get a state-sanctioned monopoly on whatever part of preparing documents, negotiating deals, and advising on compliance counts as "practicing law".  In return, the people are supposed to get higher standards of quality and service, self-policing and self-regulation by the bar, and commitments to public service, like pro bono hours and public-interest work, from license-holding lawyers, individually and as a group.

If the people of California came to me for advice on that deal today, I'd tell them to terminate, ASAP.  If there's going to be a deal going forward, the people can get better terms.

The American legal field gets divided roughly in three.  Litigators handle lawsuits.  They go to court and file papers on the public record.  Transactional lawyers do deals.  They draft terms and negotiate for their clients.  Compliance lawyers advise on following the law.  They answer questions and run internal compliance programs.

I do deals and compliance.  I have nothing to say about lawsuits or litigators.  I avoid them.  A big part of my job is helping clients avoid them, too.  Maybe society's deal with litigators is going great.  Not my field.
