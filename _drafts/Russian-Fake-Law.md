Russia's [new "fake news" law](/files/russian-fake-news-law.pdf), passed on March 4 of this year, adds three new crimes to Russian's criminal code.  It's been covered in the English-language press, with many mentions of fifteen-year jail sentences.  Media outlets are shuttering or being shuttered by it.  Emigres are citing it as a key sign prompting them to flee the country.

Here's a quick translation, to make things concrete.  Please note that [I am _not_ a Russian-qualified lawyer](https://notmylaw.com).

> **Article 207.  Public Distribution of Clearly False Information About the Use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation**
>
> 1.  Public distribution, under the guise of reliable messages, of clearly false information, including material about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation with the goal of the defense of the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens, supporting international peace and security ---
>
>     punished by fine in amount from 700,000 to 1,500,000 rubles or in amount of salary or other income determined over a period from one year to eighteen months, or correctional labor for a term of up to one year, or forced labor for a term of up to three years, or loss of liberty for the same term.
>
> 2.  The same conduct, committed:
>
>     1.  as an individual with the use of their official position;
>
>     2.  by a group of people, such group of people acting in collusion or as an organized group;
>
>     3.  with artificial creation of evidence of guilt;
>
>     4.  out of self-serving [venal, mercenary --- trans.] motives;
>
>     5.  based on political, ideological, racial, national, or religious hatred, or harm either based on hatred or harm in relation to any social group ---
>
>     punished by fine in amount from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 rubles or in amount of salary or other income determined over a period from three to five years, or forced labor for a term from five years with loss of rights to hold specified positions or conduct specified activities for a term of up to five years, or loss of liberty [imprisonment --- trans.] for a term from five to ten years with loss of rights to hold specified positions or conduct specified activities for a term of up to five years.
>
> 3.  Conduct, covered by part one or two of this article, if it brings about grave consequences ---
>
>     punished by loss of liberty for a term from five to fifteen years with loss of rights to hold specified positions or conduct specified activities for a term of up to five years.

In essence, one new crime plus two "enhancement" provisions providing for harsher sentences.  Key concepts here an indeed facially vague or conclusory.

Note that the Russian government has weaponized the concept of inciting hatred against dissidents for many years, both politically and legally.

The headline-catching fifteen-year prison penalty is in the last section, as one of the enhancements.  I am not sure whether "grave consequences" is defined elsewhere for that section.  I understand the same term has been expanded somewhat by decisions, in other contexts where it was not defined directly in the applicable law.
