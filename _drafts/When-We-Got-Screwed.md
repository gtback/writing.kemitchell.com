I keep coming around to the thought that software's still an immature industry.  Collectively, we are as children...early come into epochal gobs of cash.  New money problems plus new industry problems yields less than outstanding achievement in self-awareness.  I am also guilty, but like the rest of us, mostly at a loss to see how.

I keep looking, and on occasion, I see.

"Immature" is, of course, a lazy coward of a word.  The old beat the young with it when they know there won't be talking back.  If they knew not just _what_ they criticize, but _why_, they'd find a stronger word.  If they knew how to talk the young out of it, rather than just charge it to character and bank on Father Time, they'd find a stronger word.

Here's a more concrete observation: Software lacks a rich tragic mythology, a rich symbolic folk history of good, ground-level, rank-and-file people getting screwed.  At least as I see it, all of our dominant storytelling skews triumphant.  Scrappy nerd makes billions.  Reclusive genius canonized as fun-uncle.  Stymied angry beard spawns global insurgency.  Early hire crashes Lamborghini, laughs.

We aren't passing on grievance or warning.  Only power fantasy.  Lots of guidance for role play Iron Man, not a lot of memory joggers for how not to get squeezed off a cap table.

This isn't so in other fields.  Star comic book artists have railed for years against the mistreatments of Siegel and Shuster, Simon and Kirby.  That memory lives on in Alan Moore, Image Comics, a Creators Bill of Rights, and a thousand self-published indies.  Recording artists today know damn well why Prince became a symbol.  It comes up a lot around TayTay's re-recordings.
