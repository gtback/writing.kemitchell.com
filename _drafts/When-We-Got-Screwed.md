I keep coming around to the thought that software's still an immature industry.  Collectively, we are as children, suddenly come into a whole lot of cash.  I am also guilty, but like the rest of us, mostly unable to see how.

I keep a lookout.  On occasion, I'll catch a glance in an honest mirror.

"Immature" is, of course, a lazy coward of a word.  The old beat the young with it when they know there won't be talking back.  If they knew not just _what_ they criticize, but _why_, they'd find a stronger word.  If they knew how to talk the young out of it, rather than just charge it to character and bank on Father Time, they'd find a stronger word.

So more concretely: Software lacks a tragic mythology, an instructive folk history of fables where good, hard working types get screwed.  All the dominant stories that I think of as our canon skew decidedly triumphant: humble origin, innovative spark, resistance, pluck, victory, the end.  Spurned nerd accumulates billions.  Awkward engineer type canonized as fun uncle.  Aggrieved beard foments global insurgency.  Early hire crashes sports car, laughs it off.

We aren't passing on grievance or warning to new generations in meme form.  Only glossy power fantasy.  Lots of hints on how to role play Iron Man.  Not a lot of memory joggers for how to not get cheated, squeezed out, cut off, sold out cheap, and so on.  Hardly a complete preparation for life in a sharp-elbows world.  Offhand, private advice can't make up for this.

We should learn these stories, and make them part of what we pass along.

Other fields are on top of this.  Comic artists have railed for years against the mistreatments of Siegel and Shuster, Simon and Kirby, Howard and the Watchmen.  That collective memory lives on in Alan Moore, TMNT, a Creators Bill of Rights, the birth of Image Comics, and a thousand defiant self-publishers.  Recording artists today know damn well why so many black stars got no royalties, why Prince became a symbol for a while.  It comes up around TayTay's re-recordings, or when unsolicited checks for unlicensed samples show up in the mail.  I've yet to find a field where experience folks can't answer the question, "What're the classic stories of good people getting screwed in your industry?"
