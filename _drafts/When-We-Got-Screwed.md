I keep coming around to the thought that software's still an immature industry.  Collectively, we are as children, suddenly come into a whole lot of cash.  I am also guilty, but like the rest of us, mostly unable to see how.  I keep a lookout.  On occasion, I'll catch a glance in an honest mirror.

"Immature" is, of course, a lazy coward of a word.  The old beat the young with it when there won't be talking back.  If they knew not just _what_ they criticize, but _why_, they'd find a stronger word.  If they knew how to talk the young out of it, rather than just charge it to character and bank on Father Time, they'd find a stronger word.

I am definitely getting older.  But I think I can make my criticism more complete.

Software lacks a tragic mythology, an instructive narrative vocabulary of good, hard working types get screwed.  All the dominant stories I'd place in our canon skew triumphant: humble origin, innovative spark, resistance, pluck, victory.  Spurned nerd accumulates billions.  Awkward engineer type canonized as fun uncle.  Aggrieved beard foments global insurgency.  Frumpish early hire crashes sports car, laughs it off.

We aren't passing on warning or grievance to new generations in meme form, only glossy power fantasy.  Lots of hints on how to role play Iron Man.  Not a lot of memory joggers for how to not get cheated, squeezed out, cut off, sold out cheap.  Hardly complete preparation for life in a sharp-elbows world.  Offhand, private advice, passed one to one, can't fill the gap.

Older fields are on top of this.  Comic artists have railed for years against the mistreatments of Siegel and Shuster, Simon and Kirby, Howard and the Watchmen.  That collective memory lives on through Alan Moore, TMNT, a Creators Bill of Rights, early Image Comics, and a thousand defiant self-publishers since.  Recording artists today know damn well why so many black stars got no royalties, why session players got no credits, why Prince became a symbol for a while.  It comes up around Taylor's Versions, in talks on streaming royalties, when unsolicited checks for samples show up in the mail.

I've yet to find a field where experienced folks can't answer the question, "What're the classic warning stories of good people getting screwed in your industry?"  If someone asked me the same, I'd have to say ... _The Social Network_?  But that was early investors, not early devs.

We should learn the dark side of tech industry lore, and make it part of what we pass along.  We should have an _Aesop's Fables_ and a _Grimm's Fairy Tales_ of software, not just a "Stan Lee Presents...".  After all, life in the bullpen's never quite what it's cracked up to be.
