Tango's emphasis on paper-free, e-mail-based agreement sees the future. Having cribbed it for Waypoint only recently, I've learned that future is already here for more clients than I knew, even as a computer guy.

I suspect the Bonterms NDA's choice of first-page, configurable options hits somewhere near the optimum for maximizing adoption by both hands-on lawyers and free-roaming business people, in the aggregate. I do think it's important to give non-lawyer novices a clear path to something signable, without a lot of anxiety-inducing blank spaces. But I bet we could manage both.

You couldn't pay me enough to cede attention back to LinkedIn or Twitter. But I suspect oneNDA has planted more seeds of the standard-form idea in those fields than any effort before it. I'm not sure the world is ready to adopt a form so short and plain en masse, but I will never miss a chance to complement that kind of drafting, or to advocate for pushing those limits, wherever they seem to lie.

Digitize Legal reminds that any standard should be ready to slot into any broader solution. A standard needs intermediaries, not just lawyers and clients, adopting and benefiting.

Waypoint's emphasis on versioning, archiving, and trademark protection overcome a lot of confidence gaps. Getting informal sign-offs from colleagues in other common-law jurisdictions also helped us grow in unexpected places.
