I recently finished Eliot Higgins' [_We Are Bellingcat_](https://www.bellingcat.com/book/).  Do recommend.  Even for those who've already read some Bellingcat reports without any through-line, behind-the-scenes story.

A few impressions:

## Analytics rule everyone around me.

I was struck by how early and often Eliot mentioned numbers---page views, visitor counts, Twitter engagement---as milestones and encouragements.  Early in the story, making the numbers go up comes across as a prime motive, even as he loses his day job and frets over support of young family.

Born to the social media Skinner box, Eliot embraces the machine.  But this mouse hits the button so hard and so often, the investigators pull him our for special study.

Later in the arc, the pace markers change.  He still gives figures on some bigger stories.  But focus shifts to star-charting high-status news outlets picking up a story---that of an investigation, that of Bellingcat, that of Eliot Higgins himself.  Eventually, it even gets a bit repetitive.  New York Times, BBC, major wires, so on and so forth.  He's got all the strongest Pok√©mon.  The mission expands beyond reporting to prosecution.

## Killing our fathers.

As mainstream creds and collabs pile up, an unspoken tension rises.  The early, especially pre-Bellingcat Eliot burbles with resentment toward established journalism and even state intelligence analysis.  There are countless jabs in these directions throughout the book, some well developed, others non-sequitur.  He wants to get his punches in.

Persistently denigrating incumbents is, of course, a time honored play for sneaking your way in.  We saw this early in open-source _software_, with ESR performatively bad-mouthing industry while also transparently craving its acceptance.  I saw it again in grad school, with Sovietologists like Stephen Kotkin sniping away at colleagues in footnotes.  I vaguely remember reading that at various points in ancient Rome, successfully prosecuting an incumbent for corruption would net you their rank.  So it goes, at least some of the time.

No harms, no fouls.  The movement Eliot represents has clearly delivered some goods.  And punchiness helps build the movement.  Being the rebels while earning prizes from the empire is the best of both worlds, at the low-low price of some consistency, irrelevant to the fun.

## "OSINT" scoops take an awful lot of black market data.

The big name-and-shame scoops on [MH17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17) and the [Skripals poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal) benefited mightily from the robust black market in Russian personal data.  I'm frankly surprised how much detail Eliot gives about people willing to dole out government and corporate good.  Prices are in euros.

I suppose it's fair to say that the open-source, social-media links were just as important as the back-door data deals to the overall chains of deduction.

## We need more American targets.

## The damage.

If you think turning out software for nothing is precarious, how about binging war-crime videos all the time?

## Minions in harm's way.

## What's in a name?

As an area studies guy long involved in open-source _software_, it's fun to the term "open source" come around again.  Eliot even refers to the "open-source community" in a few places---his community, not mine.
