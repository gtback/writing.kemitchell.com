The trouble with good analogies isn't so much coming up with them as getting them out of your head once they've latched on.  One I just can't slip: contract drafting and the history of pharmacy.

I can see a legal future where advising lawyers switch from preparing most legal documents themselves to referring clients to trusted preparers to "prescribing" an ever-increasing vocabulary of specialized forms and terms by name.  All backed by progressively stronger assurances of accuracy, integrity, and repeatability, across lengthening changes of delegation from the legal professional's office.

The [International Museum of Surgical Science in Chicago](https://imss.org/) has a mock nineteenth century apothecary's shop as a permanent exhibit.

It's not terribly hard to connect the phenomenon of a guy, a mortar, a pestle, and a thousand jars of sundry ingredients to the present day.  For one, the same exists in Chinatown here in Oakland, and also among woo-woo herbalists, naturalists, homeopaths, and naturopaths in the tonier, suburban parts of town.  For two, "compounding pharmacists", who prepare drugs to meet specific needs, still fulfill a vital function in mainstream medicine.

[Says the American Pharmacists Association](https://pharmacist.com/Practice/Patient-Care-Services/Compounding/Compounding-FAQs):

> Compounding is the creation of a pharmaceutical preparation---a drug---by a licensed pharmacist to meet the unique needs of an individual patient (either human or animal) when a commercially available drug does not meet those needs.  A patient may not be able to tolerate the commercially available drug, the exact preparation needed may not be commercially available, or a patient may require a drug that is currently in shortage or discontinued.

It's the old trade-off between efficient standardization and resilient flexibility.  Compounding pharmacists handle exceptional situations where the mass-production pharmaceutical industry fails to provide what's needed "off the shelf" and the benefits of a custom preparation outweigh the costs of a one-off.

The Pharmacists Association continues:

> The U.S. Pharmacopeia Convention (USP) formally defines compounding as "the preparation, mixing, assembling, altering, packaging, and labeling of a drug, drug-delivery device, or device in accordance with a licensed practitioner's prescription, medication order, or initiative based on the practitioner/patient/pharmacist/compounder relationship in the course of professional practice."

Go back far enough, the compounding pharmacist role merges back into the physician.  Early physicians delegated not the preparation of medicines but the procurement of ingredients, to herbalists.  As specialization yielded more benefits, the compounding function left the doctor's office for the apothecary's.  In time, the production of drugs themselves was ceded to a pharmaceutical industry.  As result, the pharmacist served ever more as a go-between---a "learned intermediary"---serving critical functions like accurate dispensing, patient education, and a watchful eye for interactions---unintended consequences of multiple physicians prescribing multiple drugs for one patient.

This isn't a top-down, designed plan of progress.  It's a reflection of general developments shaping the practice of medicine by adaptation.  Nor is it a death sentence upon the profession of pharmacy.  Tasks have also flowed "down" from physicians to pharmacists, whose number, accessibility, and closeness to patients position them well for a lot of day-to-day, "primary" care.  Other tasks, like the physical picking and packing of precise amounts of precise medications, have gone to robots, which has in some cases [put pharmacists in _closer_ working contact with physicians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUjwjwZ4cLQ):

> When we added the robotic pharmacy, we redeployed the pharmacists that had been counting pills and putting them in bottles to have them work with the physician teams and round with patients to help them understand medications better.  So we feel like it was a win-win.  The pharmacists got out of doing work that was menial for them, and it allowed the machines to do what they do best, which is accurately count pills.

From the outside, as a lawyer, trying to "read in" to this system, I see a couple key mechanisms---conventions and standards---enabling collaboration.

## Prescription

The first is the prescription.  These are structured messages, adhering to a common format, that pass along the chain of delegated professional responsibility that begins between doctor and patient.  I've read descriptions of this format as of essentially four parts:

1.  a "superscription" identifying the date and the patient

2.  an "inscription" identifying the medication to be given---in the old days a recipe, today the name of a controlled drug, in either case, not something the patient can practically go out and get for themself

3.  a "subscription"--- in the old days instructions for compounding, today a quantity of controlled drug to dispense

4.  a "signature" giving instructions to the patient

I'm tempted to see in these parts the stamp of the old division of labor.  The inscription would tell an herbalist or similar broker of ingredients which to collect.  The subscription would tell the apothecary what to do with those materials.  The signature would tell the patient what to do with the apothecary's results---how much to take, when, and how often.

## Vocabulary

Prescriptions can be streamlined in large part because all professionals involved share common vocabularies of chemical, generic, and trade names for drugs.

A [key drug for lifesaving intervention in opioid overdoses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone) has the [IUPAC chemical name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry) "(4R,4aS,7aR,12bS)-4a,9-dihydroxy-3-(prop-2-en-1-yl)-2,3,4,4a,5,6-hexahydro-1H-4,12-methano[1]benzofurano[3,2-e]isoquinolin-7(7aH)-one", the [WHO-assigned International Nonproprietary Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_nonproprietary_name) or generic name "naloxone", and the trade or brand name "Narcan", among others.  The same drug, even under the same trade name, may also be available in different forms.  Thus we have Narcan nasal spray and also Narcan injection.  A higher dose of nasal spray goes by the trade name Kloxxado, but the drug involved, and therefore the generic name, remains naloxone.

When a doctor refers to or prescribes drugs by these names, they can do so with confidence they'll be understood unambiguously, and that their responsibility will hinge on what they've prescribed, with drug makers and pharmacists answering for their respective functions.  Everyone involved knows or can readily look up a direct, permanent link from a specially designed distinctive and memorable name, like "naloxone", to a specific chemical compound.  An overlapping web of safety controls and accountability mechanisms, from anti-adulteration protocols for factories, warehouses, and pharmacies to professional responsibility for accurate dispensing, enable the doctor to delegate with confidence.  Delegation may be a chain, but all the relationships involved are really cyclical, with drug manufacturers introducing new drugs into the system and pharmacists shifting focus to offer new services and cope with ever more complex patient files.
