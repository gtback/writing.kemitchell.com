title: Against Blockchain
---

It's late 2017.  Bitcoin just broke a thousand dollars.  Ethereum is two years old.  The SEC's first investigation of a blockchain scheme, The DAO, buzzes on Twitter and [the blogs](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/07/25/DAO-Report-of-Investigation.html).  The "initial coin offering" wave is rising.

I advise a stable of promising blockchain companies.  Mine are the adults in the room: older, wiser veterans with life and business experience, doggedly focused on hard technical, social, and institutional problems.  Some of them are world-class engineers.  Some of them are world-class lawyers.  Some of them have deep money-center experience.  Some of them have all of the above.

They are all trying to make blockchains do real work.  To legitimize them, legally and practically.  They aren't basking in reflected glory from their pitch decks.  They aren't pretending rules somehow don't apply to what they plan to do, or that the rules that apply are pointless.  They lived through the 2008 financial crisis as responsible adults.

I fire them all.

One by one, in careful e-mails, I end our attorney-client relationships, unilaterally.  Refer them to other lawyers, more eager to grow in the space.  Try to preserve what I can of real personal and professional bonds.  Try to make clear that it's really not about them.  I respect them.  It's about "the space".

I don't pick and choose.  Everyone blockchain gets an e-mail.  I tell them this, also.  They all get it.  I'm out.

My income dips.  I'm relieved.

Since 2017, I've occasionally been coaxed into helping someone blockchain-adjacent.  As a rule, these have been small, engineer-driven shops with strong crypto chops---actual cryptography---doing contract work and paid research for other firms.  Not startups hocking coins, tokens, or whatever the next marketable buzzword for resalable database entries will be.  But sometimes closer than I'd like.  They drink from little trickles off the great burbling river of blockchain cash.  I take comfort in the diversion of some drops to productive use.

The people are great.  The work can be, too.  Still, I am constantly tempted to cut and run.  I respect some "crypto lawyers".  I refer clients to them.  But I don't want this on me.  I don't want to be associated.

Five years ago, blockchain _disappointed_ me.  Less charitably: I got duped, felt a fool, and bowed out.  I never owned a blockchain "coin" or "token", for the same reason I've never owned a share or option of startup stock.  Clients need disinterested advice.  But there was a time, and not an insignificant one, when I believed.  I invested my time and no little of myself.  I read and wrote and coded and talked and listened.

A part of me still wants to believe, at least in the technology, as a nascent line of research.  But my faith in the capacity of the people, the ideas, and the institutions inhabiting the space to actually carry that research to meaningful fruition is gone.  The very human context in which the tech is firmly embedded is on different rails.

To make things more concrete, my immediate reasons for bailing out were basically three.

First, the work was starting to suck.  Greenfield compliance planning, regulation watching, entity structuring, and collaboration brokering challenged and excited me.  It is fun to be at the front of a new field with a lot of open questions.  But later, even if _my_ clients were grown-ups with their pants on, deals increasingly involved negotiations with business muppets---a bevy of techie nouveau papier-riche flush with more dumb cash than disciplined ideas.

Basic deals broke down under rampant "financial engineering" by free-associating amateurs, bereft of even basic business vocabulary.  Term sheets in facial violation of countless intuitive laws, often infected with dubious readings of settled law promoted by interested parties, beset my inbox.  Even when the "winners" had lawyers, those often proved recent transplants from utterly disparate specialties, trying desperately to cross-train into deals work---and not get dumped as "hidebound" obstructionists---while their clients ran amok, bandying dollar sums at orders of magnitude ripe for litigation.

The money was there.  Sophistication was not.  I wasn't playing in my league, much less above it.  I was playing rec sports with rich kids who'd all met while gambling.  Life's too short.  And the deals weren't closing.  I had no idea how to get them to close.

Second, the space was teeming with crime.  Increasingly, brazen fraud.  Like a chunk of fallen fruit swarmed by flies, it was hard to make out what the prize had ever been, under the black, gorging mass.

I had serious, realistic concerns that some overseas huckster-helper consultant would read my blog, see my tweets, and paste my bio and lawyer photo into their white paper template for their turnkey ICO-in-a-box offering.  I would spend the rest of my career explaining that no, I did not sign off on a hundred transparent securities-law violations, wholesale.  Possibly under oath.

Third, finally, and most importantly, the money the fraud made bent blockchain space-time like a black hole.  Sane and substantiated business plans along carefully charted courses swerved off toward the abyss.  If not directly---offer a coin!---than by accommodating, serving, or supplying those who did.  Months of careful back-and-forth got scrapped as even saner operators glanced over shoulders at what the less astute seemed to be getting away with, en masse.  Everybody wanted exposure to the gold of the grift.  If not with culpable directness, at some deniable remove.  No one's immune to such incentives.  Especially with a payroll to make.

Standard startup accountability mechanisms washed out.  Resources once committed to research diverted down the hole, lending critical mass to techno-babblers, showmen, and second-rate pumper-dumpers with naught to show but follower counts and "proof of steak".  All this while the technical promises remained conspicuously `TODO`.  Even dedicated researchers, retaining their funding, often turned toward the void.  Speculative exploits in novel cryptography are usually thankless work.  Here came their chance.

Alliances of interest with the peer-to-peer people, the distributed systems people, the decentralized applications people, the censorship- and surveillance-resistance people---technical movements stretching back decades, with real systems in widespread use---broke down or went blockchain.  The machine had wrung enough starter credibility out of association with their ideas, out of bandying their jargon, back when it had to borrow.  Now it was minting its own buzzwords, publishing its own "white papers"---vacuous but effective, since the new marks weren't specialists---at a superior pace.  The baggage of the prior art, its substance, became an inefficiency, a competitive liability.

It wasn't speculation sustaining a research project any longer.  It was the frayed, loose ends of a research project kindling a speculative boom.

All of this was particularly hard to take as a student of free software and open source.  It was as if this new community, however loosely defined, seemed hell bent on reproducing all of free software's failures, by frantic natural experiment.

Blockchain skeptics are in rally, thanks to Dan Olson's ["The Line Goes Up"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g).  Yes, it's two hours.  Yes, it's worth watching.  There are occasional, offhand jabs tipping the Dan's political bent, particularly on labor issues.  Maybe four or five in the whole running time.  There are some errata in details---Scuttlebutt isn't a blockchain---but only in illustrations, not on the argument path.

The argument holds, at least as far as "blockchain" hasn't delivered, won't by rocking the money-power balance of the art market, and persists by very different means.  It has only mutated, metastasized, and camouflaged, to sustain its own amorphous existence, within well known and lamentable patterns, leveraging well known and lamentable mechanisms, none of them new technology.

The rally is also correct.  Headlines, jargon, retweets, and lobbying spend do not exchange to legitimacy.  Being a thing everyone's heard of, that everyone's talking about, is not the same as being a thing that matters.

Blockchain could matter if and only if it renders service outside the closed loop of blockchain itself---real use cases other than evading or simply breaking rules and controls that make good social sense.  Not reimplementing the gold standard.  Not reimplementing coal scrip.  Not reimplementing pyramid schemes.  Not reimplementing collectibles crazes.  Not reimplementing whatever crafty and desperate fiction promoters will get away with saying distributed database entries point to next.

Some of my readers are doubtless blockchain skeptics.  If you weren't aware of my own view, you are now.

Some of my readers are doubtless blockchain enthusiasts.  If you've valued my analysis before, consider the same mind has reached a very different conclusion here.

I suspect that _all_ my readers care about technology and its place in social life.  That they look to invest in it---of their time, of their money, of their limited capacity for careful thought and productive energy.  To all of you, I would say: Look at the intellectual company blockchain kept before its alliance of convenience with easy cash turned into a rout.  Bitcoin is hardly the most important new use of cryptography in the last thirteen years, or the most interesting.  Precisely due to the ravenous bent of the ensuing occupation, those fallow lines of research are hurting for good help.  Find them, through the noise, give them help and hold them accountable.  They just might make a real difference.
