title: Against Blockchain
---

It's late 2017.  Bitcoin just broke a thousand dollars.  Ethereum is two years old.  The SEC's first investigation of a blockchain scheme, The DAO, still buzzes on Twitter and [the blogs](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/07/25/DAO-Report-of-Investigation.html).  The "initial coin offering" wave is rising.

I advise a stable of strong blockchain companies.  Mine are the adults in the room: older, wiser veterans with life and business experience, doggedly focused on hard technical, social, and institutional problems.  Some of them are world-class engineers.  Some of them are world-class lawyers.  Some of them have deep money-center experience.  Some of them have all of the above.

They are all trying to make "blockchain" do real work.  To legitimize it, legally and practically.  They aren't basking in reflected glory from their own inchoate pitches.  They aren't pretending rules somehow don't apply to what they plan, of that rules that apply have no point.  They all lived through 2008, as responsible adults.

I fire them all.

One by one, in careful e-mails, I end our attorney-client relationships, unilaterally.  Refer them to other lawyers, more eager to grow in the space.  Try to preserve what I can of real personal and professional bonds, founded on respects that continue today.  Try to make clear that it's really not about them.  It's about "the space".

I don't pick and choose.  Everyone in blockchain gets an e-mail.  I tell them this, also.

They all get it.  I'm out.

My income dips.  I'm relieved.

Since 2017, I've occasionally been coaxed into helping someone blockchain-adjacent.  As a rule, these have been small, engineer-driven shops with strong crypto chops---actual cryptography---doing contract work and paid research for other firms.  Not startups hocking coins, tokens, or whatever the next marketable buzzword for resalable database entries may be.  But sometimes closer to them than I like, feeding on little offshoots of the great burbling river of cash.

The people are great.  The work can be, too.  Still, I am constantly tempted to cut and run.  I respect some "crypto lawyers".  I refer clients to them.  But I don't want it on me.  I don't want to be associated.

Five years ago, blockchain _disappointed_ me.  In truer words, I got duped and felt a fool.  I never owned a blockchain-based "coin" or "token", for the same reason I've never owned a share or option of startup stock.  Clients deserve disinterested advice.  But there was a time, and not an insignificant one, when I believed.  I invested my time and no little of myself in the potential.

A part of me still wants to believe, at least in the technology, as a line of research as yet unrealized.  But my faith in the capacity of the people, the ideas, and the institutions inhabiting the space to actually do that research and apply it to the needs of man is gone.  The very human context in which the tech is firmly embedded has gone wrong.

To make things more concrete, my immediate reasons for bailing out were basically three.

First, the work was starting to suck.  Greenfield compliance planning, regulator watching, entity structuring, and collaboration brokering had proved challenging and exciting.  But later, even if _my_ clients were grown-ups with their pants on, deals increasingly involved negotiations with the nouveau papier-riche---business muppets flush with dumb cash.

Basic deals broke down under rampant "financial engineering" by free-associating amateurs, bereft of basic dealmaking vocabulary.  Term sheets in facial violation of countless intuitively understandable laws, often infected with bloodless memes about dubious readings of case law and statute, beset my inbox.  Even when the "winners" had counsel, those often proved recent transplants from utterly disparate specialties, trying desperately to cross-train into deals work---and not get dumped as "hidebound" innovation obstructionists---while their clients ran amok.

I wasn't playing in my league, much less above it.  I was playing rec sports with rich kids who liked to gamble.  Life's too short.  And the deals weren't closing.  I had no idea how to get them to close.

Second, the whole space was rife with crime.  Especially brazen fraud.  Like a chunk of fallen fruit swarmed by flies, it was hard to make out what the prize had ever been, under the black, teeming, gorging mass.

I had serious, realistic concerns that some pseudonymous overseas huckster-helper would read my blog, see my tweets, and paste my bio and lawyer photo into the white paper template for their turnkey ICO-in-a-box kind of service.  I would spend the rest of my career explaining that I never signed off on a hundred transparent securities-law violations.  Possibly under oath.

Third, finally, and most importantly, the money the fraud made bent blockchain space-time like a black hole.  Sane and substantiated business plans swerved toward the money, if not directly---offer a coin!---than by accommodating, serving, or supplying those who did.  Carefully crafted plans were scrapped as even saner operators looked over their shoulders at what the less astute seemed to get away with.  Everybody wanted exposure to the gold of the grift.  If not with culpable directness, at some deniable remove.

Standard startup accountability mechanisms washed out in the flood of volatile dollar denominations.  Resources once committed to research diverted down the drain, feeding the techno-babblers, the showmen, the hucksters with naught to give but "proof of steak".  All this while the technical promises, like proof of _stake_, remained conspicuously TODO.  Ever more researchers, retaining their funding, turned their attentions toward the void.

Alliances of interest with the peer-to-peer people, the distributed systems people, the decentralized applications people, the censorship- and surveillance-resistance people---technical movements stretching back decades, with real systems in widespread use---broke down or went blockchain.  The machine had wrung enough starter credibility out of association with their ideas, out of bandying their jargon, back when it was young and had to borrow.  Now it was minting its own buzzwords, publishing its own "white papers"---vacuous but effective, since the new marks weren't nerds---at a frightening pace.

It wasn't speculation sustaining a research project any longer.  It was the frayed, loose ends of a research project kindling a speculative boom.

All of this was particularly hard to take as a student of free software and open source.  It was as if this new community, however loosely defined, seemed hell bent on reproducing free software's failures, by frantic natural experiment, without taking any of its lessons.

Blockchain skeptics are in rally, thanks to Dan Olson's ["The Line Goes Up"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g).  Yes, it's two hours.  Yes, it's worth watching.  There are occasional, offhand jabs tipping the Dan's political bent, particularly on labor issues.  Maybe four or five in the whole running time.  There are some errata in details---Scuttlebutt isn't a blockchain---but only in illustrations, not on the argument path.

The argument holds, at least as far as "blockchain" hasn't delivered, won't by rocking the money-power balance of the art market, and persists by very different means.  It has only mutated, metastasized, and camouflaged, to sustain its own amorphous existence, within well known and lamentable patterns, leveraging well known and lamentable mechanisms, none of them new technology.

The rally is also correct.  Headlines, jargon, retweets, and lobbying spend do not exchange to legitimacy.  Being a thing everyone's heard of, that everyone's talking about, is not the same as being a thing that matters.

Blockchain could matter if and only if it renders service outside the closed loop of blockchain itself---real use cases other than evading or simply breaking rules and controls that make good social sense.  Not reimplementing the gold standard.  Not reimplementing coal scrip.  Not reimplementing pyramid schemes.  Not reimplementing collectibles crazes.  Not reimplementing whatever crafty and desperate fiction promoters will get away with saying distributed database entries point to next.

Some of my readers are doubtless blockchain skeptics.  If you weren't aware of my own view, you are now.

Some of my readers are doubtless blockchain enthusiasts.  If you've valued my analysis before, consider the same mind has reached a very different conclusion here.

I suspect that _all_ my readers care about technology and its place in social life.  That they look to invest in it---of their time, of their money, of their limited capacity for careful thought and productive energy.  To all of you, I would say: Look at the intellectual company blockchain kept before its alliance of convenience with easy cash turned into a rout.  Bitcoin is hardly the most important new use of cryptography in the last thirteen years, or the most interesting.  Precisely due to the ravenous bent of the ensuing occupation, those fallow lines of research are hurting for good help.  Find them, through the noise, give them help and hold them accountable.  They just might make a real difference.
