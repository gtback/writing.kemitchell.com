title: Against Blockchain
---

It's late 2017.  Bitcoin just broke a thousand dollars.  Ethereum is two years old.  The SEC's first investigation of a blockchain scheme, The DAO, buzzes on [the blogs](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/07/25/DAO-Report-of-Investigation.html).  The "initial coin offering" wave is rising.

I advise a stable of promising blockchain companies.  Mine are the adults in the room: older, wiser veterans with life and business experience, doggedly focused on hard technical, social, and institutional problems.  Some of them are world-class engineers.  Some of them are world-class lawyers.  Some of them have deep money-center experience.  Some of them all of the above.

They are all trying to make blockchains do real work.  To legitimize them, legally and practically.  They aren't basking in reflected glory from their own pitch decks.  They aren't pretending rules somehow don't apply to what they plan to do, or that those rules have no purpose.  They lived through the 2008 financial crisis as self-responsible adults.

I fire them all.

One by one, in careful e-mails, I end our attorney-client relationships, unilaterally.  Refer them to other lawyers, more eager to establish in the field.  Try to preserve what I can of good personal and professional relationships.  Attempt to reinforce that it's really not about them.  I respect them.  It's about "the space".

I don't pick and choose.  Everyone blockchain gets an e-mail.  I tell them this also.  They get it.  I'm out.  I don't want this on me.  I don't want to be associated with it.

My immediate prospects for income dip.  I am deeply relieved.

Since 2017, I've occasionally been coaxed into helping someone blockchain-adjacent.  As a rule, these have been small, engineer-driven shops with strong crypto chops---actual cryptography---doing contract work and paid research for other firms.  Not startups hocking coins, tokens, or whatever the next marketable buzzword for resalable database entries will be.  But sometimes closer than I'd like.  They drink from little trickles off the great burbling river of blockchain cash.

I take comfort in the diversion of some drops to productive use.  I feel a deep sadness seeing that is what's left to them.

Five years ago, blockchain _disappointed_ me.  Less charitably: I got duped, felt a fool, and walked away.  I never owned a blockchain "coin" or "token", for the same reason I've never owned a share or option of startup stock.  Clients need disinterested advice.  But there was a time, and not an insignificant one, when I believed.  I invested my time and no little scarce energy.  I read, wrote, and coded, talked and listened.

A part of me still wants to believe, at least in the tech as a nascent line of research.  But my faith in the capacity of the people, the ideas, and the institutions inhabiting the space to actually carry that research into the meaningful service of people is gone.  The very human context with which the tech has emerged is off those rails.

To make things more concrete, my reasons for bailing were three.

First, the work was starting to suck.  Greenfield compliance planning, regulation watching, entity structuring, and collaboration brokering challenged and excited me.  It is fun to be at the front of a new field with a lot of open questions.  But later, even if _my_ clients were grown-ups with their pants on, deals increasingly entailed negotiating with muppets---a bevy of techie nouveau papier-riche flush with more dumb cash than sense or discipline.

Basic deals broke down under rampant "financial engineering" by free-associating amateurs, bereft of even elementary business vocabulary.  Term sheets in facial violation of countless intuitive laws, often fomented by dubious readings of settled rules promoted as memes by interested parties, beset my inbox.  Even when the "winners" had lawyers, those often proved recent transplants from utterly disparate specialties, trying desperately to cross-train into dealmaking---and not get dumped as "hidebound" obstructionists---while their clients ran amok, bandying dollar sums at orders of magnitude well ripe for litigation.

The money was there.  Sophistication was not.  I wasn't playing in my league, much less above it.  I was playing rec sports with rich kids who'd met gambling.  Life's too short.  And the deals weren't closing.  I had no idea how to get them to close.

Second, the space was teeming with crime.  Increasingly, brazen fraud.  Like a chunk of fallen fruit swarmed by flies, it was hard to make out what the sustenance had been, under the black, gorging mass.

I had serious, realistic concerns that some overseas huckster-helper consultant would read my blog, see my tweets, and paste my bio and lawyer photo into their white paper and website templates for scams.  I would spend the rest of my career explaining that no, in fact I did not sign off on a hundred transparent securities law violations, wholesale.  Possibly under oath.

Third, finally, and most importantly, the money the fraud made bent blockchain space-time like a black hole.  Sane and substantiated business plans along carefully charted courses swerved ever faster toward the abyss, past event horizon.  If not directly---offer a coin!---than by accommodating, serving, or supplying those who did.  Months of careful analysis got scrapped as even saner operators glanced over shoulders at what the less astute were getting away with.  Everybody wanted exposure to the gold of the grift.  If not with culpable directness, at some deniable remove.

Even very strong people can't stand against such incentives.  Especially with a payroll to make.

Standard startup accountability mechanisms washed out.  Resources once committed to research diverted down the hole, lending critical mass to techno-babblers, showmen, and second-rate pumper-dumpers with naught to show but follower counts and "proof of steak".  All this while the technical promises remained conspicuously `TODO`, if not entirely inchoate.  Even dedicated researchers, retaining their funding, often turned toward the void.  Speculative exploits in novel cryptography are usually thankless work.  Here came their chance to bank, not directly for what they'd worked on, but what that ended up adjacent to.

Alliances of interest with the peer-to-peer people, the distributed systems people, the decentralized applications people, the censorship- and surveillance-resistance people---technical movements stretching back decades, with real systems in widespread use---became routs.  The machine wrung enough starter credibility out of association with their ideas, out of bandying their jargon, back when it had to borrow to live.

Now it was minting its own buzzwords, publishing its own "white papers", faster than even the bright, co-opted minds could come up with ideas to back them.  If vacuous, still effective.  New marks weren't specialists, or even particularly careful readers.  I saw white papers littered with footnotes that turned out to be self-cites that turned out to be IOUs for papers that hadn't been published yet.  The baggage of the prior art, the actual work on interesting systems for specific use cases, became an inefficiency, a competitive liability in the Darwinian struggle for shallow glances from wandering eyeballs.

It was no longer speculation sustaining a research project.  It was the frayed, loose ends of a research project burned up as kindling to ignite an all-consuming speculative fantasy.  The businesses born of that fantasy, who bum-rushed the regulatory environment and didn't catch a case early on, are now [folding millions of their gains into lobbying](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/crypto-lobbying-boom), extracting [content-free but symbolically useful acknowledgements from the highest rungs of power](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/03/09/executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-development-of-digital-assets/).

I could be simply indifferent, rather than angry, if not for the collateral damage.  To the research that ought to have been done.  To the concept of functional consumer and systemic financial protection.

Blockchain skeptics are in rally, thanks to Dan Olson's ["The Line Goes Up"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g).  Yes, there are occasional, offhand jabs tipping the Dan's political bent, particularly on labor issues.  Maybe four or five in the whole running time.  Yes, there are some errata in details---Scuttlebutt isn't a blockchain---but only in illustrations, not on the argument path.  Overall, it's very thorough, and very good.  Worth the candle, for the whole long running time.

Dan's argument holds, at least as far as "blockchain" hasn't delivered, won't by rocking the money-power balance of the art market, and persists by very different means.  It has only mutated, metastasized, and camouflaged, to sustain its own amorphous existence, within well known and lamentable patterns, leveraging well known and lamentable mechanisms, none of them new technology.

The rally is also correct.  Headlines, jargon, retweets, and lobbying spend do not exchange to legitimacy.  Being a thing everyone's heard of, that everyone's talking about, is not the same as being a thing that matters.

Blockchain could matter if and only if it renders service outside the closed loop of blockchain itself---real use cases other than evading or simply breaking rules and controls that make good social sense.  Not reimplementing the gold standard.  Not reimplementing coal scrip.  Not reimplementing pyramid schemes.  Not reimplementing collectibles crazes.  Not reimplementing whatever crafty and desperate fiction promoters will get away with saying distributed database entries point to next.

Some of my readers are doubtless blockchain skeptics.  If you weren't aware of my own view, you are now.

Some of my readers are doubtless blockchain enthusiasts.  If you've valued my analysis before, consider the same mind has reached a very different conclusion.

I suspect that _all_ my readers care about technology and its place in social life.  That they look to invest in it---of their time, of their money, of their limited capacity for careful thought and productive energy.  To all of you, I would say: Look at the intellectual company blockchain kept _before_ its alliance of convenience for cash turned it inside out.

Bitcoin is hardly the most important new use of cryptography in the last thirteen years.  Or the most interesting.
