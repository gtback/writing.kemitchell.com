title: Against Blockchain
---

It's late 2017.  Bitcoin just broke a thousand dollars.  Ethereum is two years old.  The SEC's first investigation of a blockchain scheme, The DAO, still buzzes on Twitter and [the blogs](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/07/25/DAO-Report-of-Investigation.html).  The "initial coin offering" wave is rising.

I advise a stable of strong blockchain companies.  My clients are the adults in the room: older, wiser veterans with life and business experience, doggedly focused on hard technical, social, and institutional problems.  Some of them are world-class engineers.  Some of them are world-class lawyers.  Some of them are world-class finance people.  Some of them have all of the above.  They are all trying to make blockchain do real work.  To legitimize it, legally and practically.  They aren't pretending a sparkly pitch suffices.  They aren't pretending the law somehow doesn't apply to them, of that the laws that apply never had a point.  They lived through 2008 as responsible adults.

I fire them all.

One by one, in careful e-mails, I end our attorney-client relationships, unilaterally.  Refer them to other lawyers, more eager to grow in the space.  Try to preserve what I can of good personal and professional bonds, founded on respect.  Try to make clear that it's really not about them.  It's about the industry.  I don't pick and choose.  Everyone in blockchain gets an e-mail.  I tell them this, too.

I'm out.  They all get it.

My immediate income prospects dip.  I am relieved.

Since 2017, I've occasionally been coaxed into helping a blockchain-adjacent firm.  As a rule, these have been engineer-driven operations with strong crypto chops---actual cryptography---doing contract work and research for other firms, rather than hocking coins or tokens or whatever the next marketable database entry is called.  The people are great, and the work often is, too.  Still, I am constantly tempted to cut the cord.  I respect some "crypto lawyers".  I refer clients to them.  But I don't want this on me.  I don't want to be associated with it.

Five years ago, blockchain _disappointed_ me.  Which is a more comforting way of saying that I felt a fool.  I never owned a coin or a token, for the same reason I've never owned a share of a client's stock.  Clients deserve disinterested advice.  But there was a time, and not an insignificant one, when I believed in the potential.  A part of me still wants to believe, at least in the technology, as a line of research.  But my faith in the capacity of the people and companies who might actually achieve and apply that line of research is broken.

The most immediate reasons for getting out were basically three:

First, the work was getting worse.  Even if _my_ clients were grown-ups with their pants on, more and more deals involved negotiations with muppets.  Basic deals broke down under rampant amateur "financial engineering", unrestrained free association, and lack of basic dealmaking vocabulary.  Even when the other side had counsel, they often proved to be a recent transplant from some other field of law, desperately trying to .

Second, the whole space was teeming with fraud.  Like a chunk of rotten fruit covered in fruit flies, it was hard to make out any of the prize under the black, teeming mass.  I had serious concerns that someone would paste my bio and lawyer portrait into the white paper template for turnkey ICO scams, and I would spend the rest of my career protesting that I never signed off on a hundred transparent securities law violations.

Third and finally, the money the fraud brought in bent the blockchain space-time continuum like a black hole, twisting business plans toward the easy money and sucking resources out of real technical research, which was hardly close to done.
