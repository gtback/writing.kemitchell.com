title: Against Blockchain
---

It's late 2017.  Bitcoin just broke a thousand dollars.  Ethereum is two years old.  The SEC's first investigation of a blockchain scheme, The DAO, still buzzes on Twitter and [the blogs](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/07/25/DAO-Report-of-Investigation.html).  The "initial coin offering" wave is rising.

I advise a stable of strong blockchain companies.  My guys are the adults in the room: older, wiser veterans with life and business experience, doggedly focused on hard technical, social, and institutional problems.  Some of them are world-class engineers.  Some of them are world-class lawyers.  Some of them have deep money-center finance experience.  Some of them have all of the above.

They are all trying to make blockchain do real work.  To legitimize it, legally and practically.  They aren't basking in the hypothetical glories of their own sparkly pitches.  They aren't pretending the law somehow doesn't apply to them, of that the laws that apply have no point.  They lived through 2008 as responsible adults.

I fire them all.

One by one, in careful e-mails, I end our attorney-client relationships, unilaterally.  Refer them to other lawyers, more eager to grow in the space.  Try to preserve what I can of good personal and professional bonds, founded on respect that continues for years to come.  Try to make clear that it's really not about them.  It's about "the space".  I don't pick and choose.  Everyone in blockchain gets an e-mail.  I tell them this, too.

They all get it.  I'm out.

My income prospects dip.  I'm relieved.

Since 2017, I've occasionally been coaxed into helping someone blockchain-adjacent.  As a rule, these have been small, engineer-driven shops with strong crypto chops---actual cryptography---doing contract work and research for other firms.  Not startups hocking coins, tokens, or whatever the next marketable buzzword for a database entry may be called.  The people are great, and the work often is.  Still, I am constantly tempted to cut the cord.  I respect some "crypto lawyers".  I refer clients to them.  But I don't want it on me.  I don't want to be associated with this.

Five years ago, blockchain _disappointed_ me.  Which is a self-ingratiating way of saying I got duped and felt a fool.  I never owned a coin, for the same reason I've never owned a share of a client's stock.  Clients deserve disinterested advice.  But there was a time, and not an insignificant one, when I believed and invested myself in the potential.

A part of me still wants to believe, at least in the technology, as a line of research.  But my faith in the capacity of the people and companies who might actually do that research and apply it to the needs of man is thoroughly broken.

The most immediate reasons for bailing out quickly were basically three:

First, the work had been interesting, but was more and more starting to suck.  Even if _my_ clients were grown-ups with their pants on, more and more deals involved negotiations with the nouveau papier-riche---business muppets flush with dumb cash.  Basic deals broke down under rampant "financial engineering" by free-associating amateurs, bereft of basic dealmaking vocabulary.  Term sheets in facial violations of countless, basic laws beset my inbox.  Even when these "winners" had counsel, those often proved recent transplants from utterly disparate fields of law, trying desperately to cross-train into deals work---and not get dumped as "hidebound" innovation obstructionists---while their clients ran amok.

I wasn't playing in my league, much less above it.  I was playing rec sports with rich kids.  Life's too short.

Second, the whole space was rife with crime, especially fraud.  Like a chunk of rotten fruit under flies, it was hard to make out what the prize was, under the black, teeming mass.

I had serious, realistic concerns that some pseudonymous overseas operator would read my blog, see my tweets, and paste my bio and lawyer photo into the white paper template for their turnkey ICO-in-a-box service.  I would spend the rest of my career explaining that I never signed off on a hundred transparent securities-law violations.  Possibly under oath.

Third, finally, and most importantly, the money the fraud brought in bent blockchain space-time like a fresh black hole.  Sane and substantiated business plans swerved toward the money hole, if not directly---offer a coin!---than by accommodating, serving, or supplying those on a more direct course.  Everybody wanted exposure to the grift.  Perhaps at some deniable remove.

Resources nominally committed to research diverted down the drain, feeding the techno-babblers, the showmen, the hucksters with naught to show but "proof of steak".  All this while the technical promises, like actual proof of stake, remained conspicuously TODO.  Alliances of interest with the peer-to-peer people, the distributed systems people, the decentralized applications people---technical movements stretching back decades---broke down.  The machine had wrung its credibility out of their buzzwords, back when it was young and weak.  Now it was minting its own, at a frightening pace.
