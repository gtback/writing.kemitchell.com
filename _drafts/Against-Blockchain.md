title: Against Blockchain
---

It's late 2017.  Bitcoin just broke a thousand dollars.  Ethereum is two years old.  The SEC's first investigation of a blockchain scheme, The DAO, still buzzes on Twitter and [the blogs](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/07/25/DAO-Report-of-Investigation.html).  The "initial coin offering" wave is rising.

I advise a stable of strong blockchain companies.  My guys are the adults in the room: older, wiser veterans with life and business experience, doggedly focused on hard technical, social, and institutional problems.  Some of them are world-class engineers.  Some of them are world-class lawyers.  Some of them have deep money-center finance experience.  Some of them have all of the above.  They are all trying to make blockchain do real work.  To legitimize it, legally and practically.  They aren't pretending a sparkly pitch suffices.  They aren't pretending the law somehow doesn't apply to them, of that the laws that apply have no point.  They lived through 2008 as responsible adults.

I fire them all.

One by one, in careful e-mails, I end our attorney-client relationships, unilaterally.  Refer them to other lawyers, more eager to grow in the space.  Try to preserve what I can of good personal and professional bonds, founded on respect that continues for years to come.  Try to make clear that it's really not about them.  It's about the "industry".  I don't pick and choose.  Everyone in blockchain gets an e-mail.  I tell them this, too.

They all get it.  I'm out.

My income prospects dip.  I'm relieved.

Since 2017, I've occasionally been coaxed into helping a blockchain-adjacent firm.  As a rule, these have been small, engineer-driven shops with strong crypto chops---actual cryptography---doing contract work and research for other firms.  Not startups hocking coins, tokens, or whatever the next marketable database entry is called.  The people are great, and the work often is.  Still, I am constantly tempted to cut the cord.  I respect some "crypto lawyers".  I refer clients to them.  But I don't want it on me.  I don't want to be associated with it.

Five years ago, blockchain _disappointed_ me.  Which is a more comforting way of saying that I got duped and felt a fool.  I never owned a coin or a token, for the same reason I've never owned a share of a client's stock.  Clients deserve disinterested advice.  But there was a time, and not an insignificant one, when I believed and invested myself in the potential.  A part of me still wants to believe, at least in the technology, as a line of research.  But my faith in the capacity of the people and companies who might actually do that research and apply it to the needs of man is thoroughly broken.

The most immediate reasons for getting out were basically three:

First, the work was starting to suck.  Even if _my_ clients were grown-ups with their pants on, more and more deals involved negotiating with nouveau papier-riche muppets flush with dumb cash.  Basic deals broke down under rampant "financial engineering" by free-associating amateurs, bereft of basic dealmaking vocabulary.  Even when they had counsel, those lawyers often proved recent transplants from utterly disparate fields of law, trying desperately to cross-train into business law---and not get dumped as "hidebound" innovation obstructionists---while their clients ran amok.  I prefer to play above my league, not below it.

Second, the whole space was teeming with crime and fraud.  Like a chunk of rotten fruit covered in fruit flies, it was hard to make out the prize under the black, buzzing mass.  I had serious concerns that someone would paste my bio and lawyer portrait into the white paper template for some turnkey ICO-in-a-box package, and I would spend the rest of my career explaining that I never signed off on a hundred transparent securities-law violations.  Possibly under oath to federal grand jurors.

Third, finally, and most importantly, the money the fraud brought in bent the blockchain space like a black hole.  Sane and substantiated business plans bent toward the money, if not directly---offer a coin!---than by accommodating those who did.  Resources that might have gone toward fundamental research diverted down the drain, feeding the techno-babblers, the showmen, the hucksters with nothing to show but "proof of steak".  All this while the technical promises, including "proof of stake", remained conspicuously `TODO`.
