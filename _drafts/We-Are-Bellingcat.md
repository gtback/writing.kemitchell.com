I recently finished Eliot Higgins' [_We Are Bellingcat_](https://www.bellingcat.com/book/).  Overall, do recommend, even for those who've followed Bellingcat stories, but without any through-line, behind-the-scenes narrative.

A few impressions:

## Analytics rule everything around me.

I was struck by how early and often Eliot mentioned analytics---page views, visitor counts, Twitter engagement---as milestones and positive reinforcements.  Early on in the story, making numbers go up comes across as the prime mover, even as he loses his day job and frets his young family.  Born to the social media Skinner box, Eliot embraces the machine.  But this mouse manages to escape.

Later in the story, the waypoints change.  Eliot still gives figures on some bigger stories, but shifts focus to mainstream, high-status news outlets picking up a story---that of an investigation, that of Bellingcat, that of Eliot Higgins himself.  Eventually, it even gets a bit repetitive reading the lists: New York Times, BCC, major wires, &c.  He has all the strongest Pok√©mon.

## Killing our fathers.

As mainstream creds and collabs pile up, an unspoken tension develops.  The early, especially pre-Bellingcat Eliot Higgins has bones to pick with established journalism and news outlets, two chipped shoulders, and a thoroughly burbling resentment.  There are countless jabs in the direction of "established" or "traditional" practice throughout the book.  Some well developed.  Some oddly non-sequitur, as if he'd made a pattern of getting them in.

## OSINT mega-scoops are OSINT plus black market.

The big scoops on [MH17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17) and the [Skripals poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal) benefited mightily from the robust black market in Russian personal data.  I'm frankly surprised how much detail Eliot gives about people willing to sell data out of the government and major corporations, like cell phone networks.  There are prices in Euros.

## We need more American targets.

## The damage.

If you think turning out software for nothing is precarious, how about binging war-crime videos all the time?

## Minions in harm's way.

## What's in a name?

As an area studies guy long involved in open-source _software_, it's fun to the term "open source" come around again.  Eliot even refers to the "open-source community" in a few places---his community, not mine.
