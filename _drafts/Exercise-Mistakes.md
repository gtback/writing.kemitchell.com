## Do not cheat range of motion.

I find it really helps to pause at both extremes when just starting out with a new movement.  Sometimes this means I don't get my target "minimum" number of repetitions per set to start.  But that's only natural spending more time doing each repetition.

If your pull-up bar is too short for you, make or find a taller pull-up bar.

## Do not fall into joints.

Control your body all the way to the bottom of falling motions like pull-ups.

## Do not neglect stretching for challenging exercises.

I've sometimes found myself limited by muscle cramps when progressing to a harder movement.  Some progressions just have big jumps in difficulty that have to be overcome by patience.  But I've often been able to avoid cramps with additional preparatory stretching specific to the movement.

Sometimes this meant stretching the muscle being worked.  For example, extra hamstring stretches helped me overcome cramps doing band-assisted nordic curls.  Other times it meant stretching something else.  For example, cramps in the bottoms of my feet limited my ability to do natural leg extensions.
