We want to give tinkerers, students, and charities free use.  We could do this like big companies, with discount and academic licensing programs.  But we're not big companies, so we "automate" it in license terms.  Noncommercial license forms are born.  [PolyForm Noncommercial](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0).
