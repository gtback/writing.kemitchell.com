title: Leverage

One of the most common kinds of attacks on computer systems is "denial of service".  The attacker sends so many requests to a website or other Internet service, at such high speed, that the service overloads.  It stops being able to respond to legitimate requests.

One key to denial of service is being able to send a lot of requests.  That's why so many denial-of-service attacks are "distributed": the attacker uses not just their own computers, but the computers of others that have been infected with viruses or other malware that allow attackers to control them remotely.  These infected, remote-controlled computers, called "bots", form large networks, called "botnets", that get created, tended, bought, sold, and rented as commodities throughout the darker corners of the Internet.

Another key to denial-of-service attacks is "leverage".  The more it costs the target to respond to each request, or to distinguish malicious attacks from legitimate ones, the fewer requests the attacker needs to make to overwhelm the service.  The details here can be quite subtle.  In the end, it's a matter of limited resources: network bandwidth, processing speed, memory, disk space, and so on.  If an attacker can exhaust one of a service's essential resources, the attacker can take that service offline.

All of this came to mind reading ProPublica's [recent piece on arbitration claims against Intuit, the company behind TurboTax](https://www.propublica.org/article/turbotax-maker-intuit-faces-tens-of-millions-in-fees-in-a-groundbreaking-legal-battle-over-consumer-fraud).  The whole article is worth reading, as are ProPublica's prior pieces on Intuit's lobby work forestalling tax reform.  But to summarize the latest: A Chicago law firm brought a class action lawsuit against Intuit related to its heavily advertised Free Edition---which reroutes some users to paid services---as opposed to its unadvertised, generally suppressed, begrudgingly provided, and now defunct Free File---offered as part of a political deal to head off IRS itself offering free filing online.  Intuit didn't fight the claims directly, but argued that users had agreed to arbitration, not lawsuits in court, under its terms of service.  The case was kicked out of court.

The Twist:  The law firm responded by advancing millions of dollars to individuals, to go ahead and bring their claims through arbitration.  Thousands and thousands of claims poured in.

The leverage?  Companies on the receiving end of arbitration claims, like Intuit, can owe thousands of dollars in fees for the private service of arbitration per claim, even if the amount the claim is far smaller:

> At a hearing before U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer, a lawyer for Intuit complained that "the Keller firm is able to threaten companies---Intuit's not alone---into paying $3,000 in arbitration fees, for a $100 claim."

You can find fee schedules for the major US arbitration organizations, [AAA](https://adr.org/rules) and [JAMS](https://www.jamsadr.com/arbitration-fees), online.

In addition, under the arbitrators' rules, one or the other side can also end up owing the other side's attorneys' fees.

This tactic has been dubbed "mass arbitration".
