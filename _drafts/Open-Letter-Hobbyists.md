Published widely in magazines and computer club newsletters.

> ¶ To me, the most critical thing in the hobby market right now is the lack of good software courses, books and software itself.  Without good software and an owner who understands programming, a hobby computer is wasted.  Will quality software be written for the hobby market?

This framing feels very conscious, and in my view very correct.  There is an inherent tension in any engrossing craft---be it software development, legal drafting, motorcycle mechanics, or visual art---between the joy of the craft and service to the people.  The more concessions from the broader community the craft requires to sustain its practices, the more the interests of those outside the craft assert themselves over the interests of those within it.  Self-service is fine when it costs others nothing.

> ¶ Almost a year ago, Paul Allen and myself, expecting the hobby market to expand, hired Monte Davidoff and developed Altair BASIC.  Though the initial work took only two months, the three of us have spent most of the last year documenting, improving and adding features to BASIC.

There has always been a certain breezy, intrinsic joy in the initial act of expressing an idea in software.  And there has always been a lot more work to do than that in making that work useful to anyone else.

> Now we have 4K, 8K, EXTENDED, ROM and DISK BASIC.  The value of the computer time we have used exceeds $40,000.

Emphasis on what has been output---what could be useful to others.  But only lockstep with what has been input---what has been sacrificed to make it come about.

> ¶ The feedback we have gotten from the hundreds of people who say they are using BASIC has all been positive.  Two surprising things are apparent, however, 1) Most of these "users" never bought BASIC (less than 10% of all Altair owners have bought BASIC), and 2) The amount of royalties we have received from sales to hobbyists makes the time spent on Altair BASIC worth less than $2 an hour.

This appeal from unfairness, an argument from disparity, is easy to find in writing about open software these days.  Developer churns out useful library.  Developer applies broadly permissive MIT license.  Library takes off.  Developer becomes very busy.  Multinational firm or well capitalized startup announces big valuation, huge IPO, other windfall.  Developer struggles to solicit minimum wage in donations, cries foul.

> ¶ Why is this?  As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software.  Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share.  Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?

Confrontational.  Accusatory.

The difference, of course, is that Micro-Soft didn't offer its work for free.  Its terms required payment.

Problem being, back then, at least for hobbyists, the norm was free, no matter what the terms said.

The norm now, at least for programmers insulated from business by managers, is much the same.  If you can download it online without entering a credit card, it's free for the taking.

> ¶ Is this fair?

Explicitly now: appeal from unfairness.

> One thing you don't do by stealing software is get back at MITS for some problem you may have had.  MITS doesn't make money selling software.

MITS, or Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, made the Altair 8800, a very popular hobby computer.

So popular that Gates and Allen, seeing the 8800 in _Popular Electronics_, pitched MITS a vaporware BASIC implementation, scrambled to emulate the machine and build it, demoed to the company in Albuquerque, and moved there to work for them with Allen, taking him away from Harvard.

> The royalty paid to us, the manual, the tape and the overhead make it a break-even operation.  One thing you do do is prevent good software from being written.

> Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?

These days, a great deal of professional work is in fact done for nothing.  But many of those professionals find they can't really afford it.

> What hobbyist can put 3-man years into programming, finding all bugs, documenting his product and distribute for free?

> The fact is, no one besides us has invested a lot of money in hobby software.  We have written 6800 BASIC, and are writing 8080 APL and 6800 APL, but there is very little incentive to make this software available to hobbyists.

> Most directly, the thing you do is theft.

> ¶ What about the guys who re-sell Altair BASIC, aren't they making money on hobby software?  Yes, but those who have been reported to us may lose in the end.  They are the ones who give hobbyists a bad name, and should be kicked out of any club meeting they show up at.

> ¶ I would appreciate letters from any one who wants to pay up, or has a suggestion or comment.  Just write me at 1180 Alvarado SE, #114, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87108.  Nothing would please me more than being able to hire ten programmers and deluge the hobby market with good software.
