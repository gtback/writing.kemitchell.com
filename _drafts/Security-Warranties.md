title: Warranties Solve Security at Scale
description: the open source skeptics warned us
---

How do you get too few nerds, with scarce, specialized knowledge, who require a lot of focus and attention, bearing down on the right software, in the right versions, at the right time, with the right financial, material, intellectual, and legal support, forever?  How do you incentive the right investments in channeling and preempting the knowledge of these specialists into production-side, preventive methods, tools, and techniques?

The solution to the software security crisis isn't [standardized packing slips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bill_of_materials).  It isn't [a centralized inspection agency](https://openssf.org/) or a [sign-off scheme](https://blog.tidelift.com/the-state-of-package-signing-across-package-managers), either.  Software security isn't actually a technical problem.  It's more complex than that.  But it's also a solved problem.

Allocating talent, resources, and responsibility for software security is a specific instance of the general product-service safety and reliability problem.  Users need and want software, but they can't tell whether it's safe.  The developers are in the best position to know.  The general solution is warranties and indemnities---written guarantees, backed by legally enforceable financial accountability, of quality, safety, reliability, and other product attributes---rooted in legal accountability for harm to end consumers.  The result is a decentralized, self-assembling, self-balancing, many-nodes, many-edges network of insurance-like risk-for-reward exchanges.  In other words, a "market", in very scary scare quotes.  "Markets" have well known failure modes, usually related to enforcement by consumers and regulatory capture.  But far fewer than public-goods crisis chasing.

Software used where it matters should come with warranties that the software---licensed or hosted---isn't flawed by design, full of holes, built with back doors, or left in disrepair.  Those warranties should live in contracts with solvent, sue-able counterparties, so when failures happen, vendors pay.  The customers benefiting from that assurance should pay for it.  They should answer to their own customers, regulators, and incentives in securing sufficient warranties and deciding whether to fund redundant audits, require adherence to standards, or carry insurance.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, I was one of the kids with a dial-up connection flaming the business meanies throwing shade on open source as negligence or kids' stuff without any vendor "standing behind the product".

The idea that people would use software without paying for it wasn't crazy, irrational, or unethical.  It was awesome.  Probably because I didn't have any money.

The idea that people would use software without getting any assurance of quality, safety, or reliability wasn't reckless, demeaning, or unprofessional.  It was great.  Probably because nothing I was doing was all that important, and I actually _enjoyed_ burning time hunting bugs and riffling through alternatives.

Open source is, by practical definition, free of charge.  In the overwhelming majority of use cases, nothing flows back from users to producers.  And as for warranties, every popular open source license says something like the following, usually in `SHOUT CAPS`:

> The software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied....

Licenses have to say this because the law, in its labyrinthine wisdom, has a habit of implying all kinds of reasonable default rules about responsibility for the quality of things we buy and sell.  Including warranties for software, at least when it's sold.

In fact, certain states of the United States---those adopting [UCITA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCITA)---and, I'm told, several foreign countries, such as Germany, actually prevent standard open source warranty disclaimer language from having full effect.  In those jurisdictions, there are some basic warranties you just can't waive away with a word.
