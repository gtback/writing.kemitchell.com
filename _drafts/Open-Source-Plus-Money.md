<!-- TODO: title without open source -->

Revisiting open source writing from the '90s and early 2000s, I'm struck by just how awkwardly boosters danced around money and business.  "Open Source" courted industry, but also performatively bad-mouthed it.  "Free Software" was emphatically _not against business_, but obviously was, and often gratingly so.  Money in online software dev would ruin it for everyone, but every new full-time gig was a shared dream come true.  The latest <abbr title="initial public offering">IPO</abbr> pop always made top news, but open source transcended capitalism, condemned markets to obsolescence.

["Wikinomics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics) for the C-suite.  ["Commons-based peer production"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks) for the faculty lounge.  ["Bazaar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) for dimly lit dorms where modems kept warm.  An economy without prices, production without profit, a flea market of bytes where money never changed hands.  Exceptionalism for one and all.  Because the Internet.

Looking back, out of the moment, we can spot the rationalization and self-promotion, riven with all the gaps and contradictions we can only expect from fellow human beings.  Open source mythmaking wasn't open source reality but just another reflection of underlying realities, ever indifferent to our understanding.  Big things were happening to coders and the industry, fast.  We needed to feel we somehow had our heads around it.

"Open Source" never really grappled with money.  It solved problems, but never took that in as a factor.  It didn't have to.  Enough people made bank---sometimes despite themselves, othertimes trying to seem so---at least to start.  And for all involved, winners or losers, dropping the money term made solving the equation so much simpler.  Grind as model may against reality, the result was clean, and therefore felt correct.  Feelings, more than anything, got us bleating, repeating, and cheering on.

The reality was "personal computing" and elite consumer Internet penetration.  Suddenly, savvy nerds in relatively affluent circumstances and the kids of savvy parents in relatively affluent circumstances got free, fast, public distribution for their wares.  They used it to build free, fast, public collaboration.

Starting from nil, it was easier _not_ to charge, _not_ to throttle, _not_ to set permissions or enforce them.  The Web is decades old now, and authentication is still weird and awful inside.  [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu)---complete with access controls and even content royalty payments---remains trivia.  The Web's standards inheritance reflects what was viable enough to spread, not any forward-thinking concept of a complete product.  We're ever more feeling the lack.

When open source was born, the fundamental story was "we have the Internet", where "we" referred to rather select and self-selected group of people.  That isn't the story anymore.  Now it's "_everyone_ has the Internet".  More than half of humanity's online.  Billions of us.

The force that cannot be stopped in software is the force of literally millions of untapped talents serving other connected people with software.  The work of networking a few thousand elect and distributing their outputs to the masses continues, but the explanation and hype that greased that process, twenty or thirty years ago, no longer explain, much less govern, what's happening now, or what needs to be done about it.  In the large, the mental framing of open source, or open source versus proprietary, has become a hindrance.

Unlocking mass human software potential requires restoring the old maxim of honest work for honest pay.  We must recouple money earned and value received.  No group of people is better positioned to achieve this than programmers.  We are the people who automate counting and copying and paying for things at scale.

As one of those grown-up kids whose middle-class parents brought a PC and dial-up into the home early, I am extremely sympathetic to the idea that money ruins everything online.  The 90s and early 2000s felt special, more special than now, and we were still scared to use credit cards on the Internet back then.  Correlation or causation?  Correlation or nostalgia?

As one of those grown-up kids, it's been hard to understand that for the vast majority of people now online, "money will ruin the community" isn't a feel-good callback to halcyon days of yore, but social [Catch-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22).  Most people can't break into coding $0 software sans material support.  That door isn't open to them by default, but closed.  To let them in, we have to let money in with them.  We let them in with money.  But letting money in---or is it letting them in?---will, we say, ruin it.  So we say as credentialed members of the "community".

It's a mass online equivalent of the swank business club downtown.  The value of the club is exclusivity.  No exclusivity, not the same club.  And the idea that the current, exclusive kind of club is the best kind to have---that software and other work online is best produced by "peers" who can afford to work for nothing or command substantial patronage---implies that defending the unsullied preserve of the few promises more than the untapped potential of the masses.  There are way fewer open-source gigs at large companies and the foundations they fund than potential open-source programmers.

The lack of a mass money model for software today is where the lack of mass participation in monopoly-driven software of the 1990s did: standing in the way of the greatest untapped source of programmer potential.

This view is just one symptom of living the future in the early 2000s and falling into the past circa 2020.  There are others.  It's now easier for most people online to publish photos or even videos than code, for example.  Same for long blog posts.  Anyone who's tried to author a patch on a smartphone knows this.  Most people don't surf with physical keyboards.  Kids approach 100 wpm with three fingers on phones, with and without autocorrect.

Internet technology made communication between anyone and nearly anyone else shocking possible.  Society---nearly all societies---are still dealing with that traumatic turn of events.

<!-- Broad acceptance of permissive licensing made scale differences irrelevant.  Big companies could give and take from sole hackers.  The same hasn't happened for paid transactions. -->

<!-- TODO: return to old "honest pay for honest work" versus financialization, which introduces money with or (usually) without anything useful being done -->

<!-- TODO: so slipper slope to the extreme, be it proprietary licensing of financialization -->
