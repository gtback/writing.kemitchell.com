Revisiting open source writing from the '90s and early 2000s, I'm struck by just how twisted a path its boosters plotted around money and business.  "Open Source" courted industry, but also performatively bad-mouthed it.  "Free Software" was emphatically _not against business_, but obviously was, often gratingly so.  Money in online software dev would ruin it for everyone, but every new full-time gig was a personal dream come true, a collective triumph.  The latest initial public offering pops made top news, but open source transcended capitalism, threatened to make markets obsolete.

["Wikinomics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics) for the C-suite.  ["Commons-based peer production"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks) for the faculty lounge.  ["Bazaar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) for dimly lit dorms where modems kept warm.  An economy without prices, production without profit, a flea market of bytes where money never changed hands.  Exceptionalism for one and for all.  Old rules, now objects of scorn, no longer bound.  Because the Internet.

Looking back, out of the moment, we can spot the rationalizations, the self-promotion, riven with all the gaps and contradictions we've learned to expect.  Not the underlying realities, ever indifferent to our understanding, but reflections of them---hasty, dim, and a more than a little warped.  Big things were happening to coders and the industry.  Changes came fast.  We needed to feel we somehow had our heads around it.  We needed a thing with a name would cheer on, rather than worry about.

"Open Source" never really grappled with money.  It never took it into the equation to be solved.  It didn't have to.  Enough people made bank---sometimes despite themselves, sometimes trying to seem so---at least to start.  And for all involved, winners or losers, dropping the money term made solving the equation simpler.  Grind as model may against reality, the solution was clean, and therefore felt correct.  Feelings, more than anything, are what got us bleating and repeating in the first place.

The reality was consumer Internet penetration.  Suddenly, savvy nerds in relatively affluent circumstances got free, fast, public distribution for their wares.  They used it to build free, fast, public collaboration.  It was easier _not_ to charge, _not_ to throttle, _not_ to set permissions or enforce them.  The Web is decades old now, and authentication is still weird and awful inside.  [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu)---complete with access controls and even content royalty payments---remains trivia.

We're ever more feeling the lack.  "We have the Internet" isn't the story anymore.  It's closer to "_everyone_ has the Internet".  More than half of humanity's online.

The force that cannot be stopped is the force of literally millions of untapped talents serving other connected people with software.  The work of networking a few thousand elect and distributing their outputs to the masses continues, but the explanation and hype that greased that process, twenty or thirty years ago, no longer explain, much less govern, what's happening or needs to be done about it.  In the large, the mental framing of open source, or open source versus proprietary, has become a hindrance.

Unlocking mass human software potential requires restoring the old maxim of honest work for honest pay.  We must recouple money earned and value received.  No group of people is better positioned to achieve this than programmers.  We are the people who automate counting and copying and paying for things at scale.

Internet technology made communication between anyone and nearly anyone else shocking possible.  Society---nearly all societies---are still dealing with that traumatic turn of events.
