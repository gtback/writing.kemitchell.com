title: Open Source Plus Money
description: why are programmers the last to
---

I've been rereading notes on open source from the '90s and early 2000s.  I'm struck by just how twisted a path they plotted around money and business.  "Open Source" courted industry, but also performatively bad-mouthed it.  "Free Software" was emphatically _not against business_, but obviously was, and pretty gratingly so.  Money in online software dev would ruin it for everyone, but every new full-time gig was a personal dream come true, a collective triumph.  The latest initial public offering pops were top news, but open source transcended industrial capitalism, maybe even the market as a whole.

["Wikinomics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics) for the C-suite.  ["Commons-based peer production"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks) for the faculty lounge.  ["Bazaar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) for dimly lit dorms, offices, and basements, wherever modems kept warm.  An economy without prices, a production system without profit, a flea market of bits where money never changes hands.  Exceptionalism for one and all.  Because the old rules no longer applied.  Because the Internet.

Looking back, we see the rationalizations, the overt self-promotions, riven with all the gaps and contradictions we've learned to expect.  We don't see the underlying realities, ever indifferent to our understanding, but reflections of them---hasty, dim, and a little warped here and there.  Big things were happening to programmers and the industry.  Change was coming fast.  We needed to feel we had our heads around it.  We needed a thing with a name would cheer for and belong to.

"Open Source" never really grappled with money.  It never took it into the equation to be solved.  It didn't have to.  Enough people made bank anyway---sometimes despite themselves, sometimes trying to make it seem so---at least to start.  And for all involved, winners or losers, dropping the money term made solving simpler.  Grind as the model may against reality, the solution remained clean, ergo correct, at emotionally speaking, which is why he talked up a model in the first place.

The reality was consumer Internet penetration.  Suddenly, savvy nerds in relatively affluent circumstances got free, fast, public distribution of their wares.  They used it to build free, fast, public collaboration in development.  It was easier _not_ to charge, _not_ to throttle, _not_ to set permission bits.  The Web got built, and authentication is still weird and awful.  [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu)---complete with access controls and even content royalty payments---did not.

We're ever more feeling the lack.  "We have the Internet" isn't the story anymore.  It's closer to "_everyone_ has the Internet".  More than half of humanity's online.

The force that cannot be stopped is the force of literally millions of untapped talents serving other connected people with software.  The work of networking a few thousand elect and distributing their outputs to the masses continues, but the explanation and hype that greased that process, twenty or thirty years ago, no longer explain, much less govern, what's happening or needs to be done about it.  In the large, the mental framing of open source, or open source versus proprietary, has become a hindrance.

Unlocking mass human software potential requires restoring the old maxim of honest work for honest pay.  We must recouple money earned and value received.  No group of people is better positioned to achieve this than programmers.  We are the people who automate counting and copying and paying for things at scale.

Internet technology made communication between anyone and nearly anyone else shocking possible.  Society---nearly all societies---are still dealing with that traumatic turn of events.
