title: Open Source Plus Money
---

Rereading open source boosters of the '90s and early 2000s, I'm struck by just how twisted a path they danced around money and business.

"Open Source" courted industry, but also constantly bad-mouthed it.  "Free Software" was emphatically _not against business_, but obviously was, and pretty gratingly so.  Money in open source would ruin it, but every new full-time gig was a personal dream, a collective triumph.  Top news was latest initial public offering pops galore, but open source transcended markets, maybe even capitalism.

["Wikinomics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikinomics) for the C-suite.  ["Commons-based peer production"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks) for the faculty lounge.  ["Bazaar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar) for dimly lit dorms, offices, and basements, wherever modems were keeping warm.  Exceptionalism for one and all.  An economy without prices, production without profit, a flea market of bits where money never changes hands.  Because all the old rules no longer applies.  Because Internet.

Looking back, we see the rationalizations, the overt self-promotions, riven with all the gaps and contradictions we ought to expect.  We don't see the realities, ever indifferent to our understanding, but reflections of them, hasty, dim, and a little warped here and there.  Big things were happening to programmers and the industry.  We needed to feel we had our heads around it.

"Free Software" and "Open Source" never grappled with money.  Not in practice, not in theory.  They never took that factor into the equation to solve.  It didn't have to.  So it wasn't part of the solution.  Enough people made money anyway, at least to start.  And for all involved, winners or losers, dropping the money term made things simpler.  The model slipped and ground against reality, but the solution remained bewitchingly clean, ergo correct.

Open Source cried "We have the Internet!".  Suddenly, relatively savvy nerds in relatively affluent circumstances got free, fast, public distribution.  They used it to build free, fast, public collaboration.  If was easier and more expedient _not_ to charge, _not_ to throttle, _not_ to set permission bits.

It's not "we have the Internet" anymore.  It's closer to "_everyone_ has the Internet".  More than half the world's population.  The force that cannot be stopped is the force of literally millions of untapped talents serving others with software.  The work of networking a few thousand elect and distributing their outputs to the masses continues, but the explanation and hype that greased that process, twenty or thirty years ago,

Unlocking mass human software potential requires restoring the old maxim of honest work for honest pay.  We must recouple money earned and value received.  No group of people is better positioned to achieve this than programmers.  We are the people who automate counting and copying and paying for things at scale.

Internet technology made communication between anyone and nearly anyone else shocking possible.  Society---nearly all societies---are still dealing with that traumatic turn of events.  [Russian state TV has a show where they debunk social media memes.](https://www.1tv.ru/shows/antifeyk/o-proekte)
