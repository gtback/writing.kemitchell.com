I signed the open [Letter in Support of Responsible Fintech Policy](https://concerned.tech) calling on members of the United States House and Senate to take a skeptical view of ongoing blockchain lobbying.  Because I strongly agree with it.

Independence is the first privilege of a freelance professional.  Independence writes this blog.  But many of the careful readers out there will have noticed that I haven't posted anything on blockchain since July of 2017.  It's the one big, obvious topic I've denied myself, and not for lack of what to say.  For all but five whole years.

Five years ago, Bitcoin had just broken a thousand dollars.  Ethereum reached two years old.  The Securities and Exchange Commission's first investigation of a blockchain scheme, "The DAO", buzzed on [the blogs](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/07/25/DAO-Report-of-Investigation.html), including this one.  The "initial coin offering" wave was rising.

I advised a stable of promising blockchain clients.  Mine were the adults in the room: older, wiser veterans with life, business, and legal experience, focused on hard technical, policy, and institutional problems.  All were trying to make blockchains do real work.  All were trying to legitimize the tech, legally and practically.  They weren't basking in reflected glow from their pitch decks.  They weren't pretending daring-do or unfathomable tech-magic exempted them from all public policy.  They'd lived through the 2008 financial crisis as self-conscious, responsible adults.

I fired them all.

One by one, in careful e-mails, I ended our attorney-client relationships.  Referred them to other counsel, more eager to be "crypto lawyers".  Tried as I could to preserve personal rapport, founded on deep personal and professional respect.  I did what I could to explain, succinctly and honestly, that it really wasn't them.  It was the whole "space".  I'd had enough.  I was out.  Every blockchain client got an e-mail.  I made no exceptions.

My income prospects tanked.  I was deeply relieved.  And I still am.  I've taken some blockchain-adjacent clients since, all small, engineer-driven concerns doing actual cryptography on trickle-down dollars.  But nobody hocking chains, coins, tokens, or whatever buzzword's next.  I've lost track of all the new business I've turned down.  Gladly.

My pretenses against blockchain were and remain basically three: the work, the tech, and the bullshit.

As a lawyer, the work increasingly sucked.  Legal "greenfield" is fun, but we weren't alone out there, and even ace clients increasingly sat across from jokers, sometimes recently made, on meaningful deals.  Countless negotiations were derailed by rampant neophyte "incentives engineering".  Countless proposals, earnestly made at great time expense, were debunked at intro-business-law-course level.  But even setting fools aside, many clients who held out against temptation to issue a "coin" for quick cash nonetheless succumbed to serving those who caved.  If the people wanted to mine for shit, there was money in pickaxes, transportation, and advice.  The company stunk, but at least it made an honest living.

I got it.  Among the startup-founder precariat, temptation was massive.  You're worried about payroll on one hand.  You're sick at the thought of pounding pavement for pro finance on the other.  Suddenly, a new exit sign: offramp to Easy Street.  In the right (wrong) circumstances, we have to expect even the strongest to take it.  I did not and do not judge.  But I did have a choice.  Five years of my prime down the line, I'm glad to have frittered them otherwise.

As a coder, it gutted me seeing the attention, the money, and the brains evacuated out of scene after scene.  Their times in the spotlight finally came, but nascent and frail, the heat basically incinerated them on the spot.  Peer-to-peer.  Privacy-first engineering.  User-friendly cryptography.  The fuel of the machine was tech cred.  The marketeers were burning it like a fleet of HMMWVs invading a flat, defenseless country, on someone else's dime, first one to the capital gets to go to the moon.

Some good coders---hell, even unsuspecting grad students---got unexpected paydays, care of promoters with promises to fill.  But even ignoring the worthy and overlooked, who didn't, a lot of those blessed went the way of [the HURD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd).  Five years is a lot of years in software land.  The sole invariant requirement---speculative fundability---has been fulfilled again and again, sometimes quite without any functional software, or with PDFs thick with buried `TODOs`.

Dominant chain nodes still radiate surrounding space solving nothing.  Private-key crypto is still fraught and user-hostile.  The databases remain slow and expensive, in the midst of a multicloud commodification war.  "Decentralization" is most often tactically vague, and when achieved in any meaningful sense also promptly sacrificed in the event of meaningful adoption.  Privacy properties remain largely ill-conceived or simply contrived.  The leaves off these branches not facing the money have withered off, starved, or simply been pruned away.  A lot of good devs who know better are grinding away on bullshit.

Basic research is hard.  Industrialization is hard.  Doing both is miraculous.  Allocating resources to call forth the whole process, under one guiding hand, on the basis of promotional talent, has again proved unwise.  Even the amalgamated, monetized want of thousands of suggestible speculators cannot simply will and fund a meaningful innovation into being.  We ought to be funding more good devs and great dev managers.  Fewer social media scene creatures.  That's not the system "crypto" come to denote.

Finally, as a citizen who graduated college in 2009, the worst was the mounting, obvious crime and fraud, the money that crime and fraud made, and the speed with which the money turned around on the system the crime and fraud first evaded.  Perhaps this shouldn't have come as any great surprise.  It was a short mutagenic jump from reinvesting in hype to reinforcing "community" to running a direct and self-conscious lobby operation, initially on the regulators, then over their heads to the pols.

Nobody needs this blog to parade horribles or define the new jargon coined for all the old heists and scams ported to the new system.  Suffice to say it was obviously bad enough in 2017 that even a longtime computer programmer with a Russian hacker fascination, who did research for a securities law don in law school and had a career plan derailed by financial sanctions, could read the writing on the wall.  Largely by repeating self-serving nonsense about how criminal use was somehow negligible and securities laws somehow didn't apply---and finding plenty of lawyers willing to reify that latter thought on paper, and eventually to work the predictable litigation---the critical, interested mass rushed the regulators.  They got too far down, too quickly:  it's not coming back up now, but heading all the way through, damage be done all the way.

That's where we're headed now, if we cut blockchain an exception to rules that make sense just for being blockchain, to see where it goes under whatever, looser standard it can buy.  This in marked contrast to laws of the past that specifically clarified that old scams with new tech---the mails, the wires, now the Internet---could do more damage.  Half of humanity is now online.  Being online increasingly includes sending and receiving money.  Never have so many predators been gifted infrastructure to sift so many potential prey.

As becomes clear to anyone who bothers to read and think about the years of the important legal decisions, the prospect of technology altering this balance of harm and power was hardly news upon our forebears.  The banking and money transfer laws were written to deny criminals the future as well as present capabilities of those systems.  The securities and fraud laws were given flexibly to prevent the of old scams from slipping through in new guises.  Where terms are vague, lawyers see the cue to look to the "policies"---the purposes behind the legal language, often stated in the very same laws.  Those fundamental interests remain the same, and they don't include accepting mass Main Street collateral damage because boosters have the pluck to irradiate characterization questions with new jargon and details that do not matter.

I don't support cracking down on blockchain just for being blockchain.  A scene being riven with data heisters, confidence men, and bucket shop jockeys does not condemn others not so involved---be they true believers or earnest fools---by abstract association.  But neither do I support special privileges for those in denial or indifference to the unwelcome company their work keeps.

Our Federal Government is certainly receiving signal that the blockchain phenom has gathered resources unto itself.  But they should not mistake money spent for its favors for money earned.  That is missing half the balance sheet: all the many promises made and left outstanding.  And also the fact they themselves printed the money, so much it had scarcely elsewhere to go.

Neither should Congress confuse the hype machine's striking capacity to find and summon grievances---banking access, financial consolidation, transfer network improvement, predatory lending, monetary policy---with any capacity to address them.  The proper tools are known, but they aren't found in any "white paper".  They are found on parchment paper, in the Constitution, vested in Congress.
