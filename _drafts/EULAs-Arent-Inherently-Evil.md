Too many software developers simply cannot conceive that a dreaded "proprietary software license" could be reasonable, fair, and beneficial to users.  That they might rationally _prefer_ such terms, and paying for software, to free MIT or GPL for code they actually use.

It happens.  It's all about terms and circumstances.

"Proprietary" paints all not-free-and-open terms the same.  In fact it's the whole universe of hackable permutation and combinations, minus a very short list of "open" licenses, largely written ages ago.

Consider a "proprietary" deal like so:

- $n per year, annual term, renewing automatically
- binary and source, delivered via download
- the customer gets the current version plus any new ones released while they're still paying
- the customer can keep using those versions after they stop paying, but not any newer releases
- the customer can run, patch, and run as patched, but not share with others
- patches must be shared and licensed back to the developer
- the seller guarantees the software will work as documented, won't be infected with malware, won't be riddled with security holes, won't contain unlicensed or plagiarized code
- the seller provides support and maintenance via e-mail, with a response-time service-level agreement (SLA)
- if the developer discontinues maintenance, the software falls back onto some standard free-of-charge license, agreed in advance

There's nothing inherently abusive here.  Depending on the software, the price, and the competition, it's just a good deal or a bad one.  Those who take the deal aren't "locked in" by some dark legal magic.  They _could_ become dependent on the software and the vendor, for lack of competition or a failure to diversify.  Not due to any legal hooks hidden in the contract.

Through the lens of free and open source ideology, of course, it's the road to serfdom and a recipe for shitware.  Many "freedoms" are present, but some are not, and the matter is binary `AND`.  The customer's debased, cast down to servitude, bound in chains of copyright.  The software will wither, die, and start to rot.

But also, as we know, exceedingly unlikely to care.  Through the lens of lived industry experience, we see that what users reliably need and want, they get on this deal.  Plus a lot they can only hope for from open source.

Of all the projects we use, we contribute to very few.  We fork-adopt fewer still.  We download software direct from where developers put it---GitHub, language-specific repositories---rather than passing among friends.  We don't like paying just to try something out, but once we're in, we immediately start worrying whether the project will fall out from under us.  The question shifts from the software as such to all the life-support work to sustain it---doc, bugs, maintenance, security, roadmap---and the other people we hope will do it for us.

In all likelihood, practically speaking, users under a proprietary deal like this concede a whole lot of nothing.  Permission for things they won't want to do.  Protections against problems they won't have.  In return, they get realistic benefits where they likely _will_ have need.  Consider:

- The customer gets source and permission to hack it.  This is way more normal in business-to-business software deals than hackers tend to think.

- The license is "perpetual".  The seller can't cut them off from what they already have, only future releases, services, and risk protections.

- The customer can fix bugs and make improvements.  Better yet, while they pay, they can foist this off on the seller.  What the customer could usually only hope for in the best case with open source---a timely response from a responsible person---they now get by right, under contract.

- If the seller drops the product, the customer can fork and maintain under fallback license, or hire someone else to do so.

- There's no "sustainability" mystery to leave unsolved and try not to think about.  The customer pays the developer.  Other would-be users face the same deal.

In short, instead of maxing out user interests at the total expense of devs', the license agreement _aligns_ their interests.  The developer gets paid.  But it also takes responsibility:

- If the software is unreliable, the seller will have to spend more on support and maintenance to meet its obligations.

- If the seller under-invests in development, customers won't renew and the seller will lose revenue.

- If the software's riddled with bugs or vulns, the customer can hold the seller responsible.  They don't have to wish on "best practices", free-for-open giveaways, or roving inspectorates funded by their competitors.

The effect is something like a foundation where all the users actually donate.  Except the "foundation" is a company that can make a profit.  Which is hardly wrong.  It's probably what the users are after.

I write a lot of legal terms, including license terms.  Legal terms have _no inherent value_, and certainly no inherent _ethical_ value.  They matter only when applied, in context, to move property and shape behavior.  They shape behavior by invoking sense of duty, staking reputation, and structuring incentives.  Usually backed by a reliable, independent legal system.

In many circumstances, software users and software developers will _both_ be better off under paid commercial terms informed by practical outcomes and their probabilities than they would be under comparatively easy-to-grok, absolutist terms at some clean extreme, permissive open-source or full-lockdown proprietary.  Out in the world, when more is involved and at stake than abstract principle, that's often the more responsible, and the more ethical, way to go.

Legal terms are just tools.  Permissive, copyleft, and commercial are just kinds of them.  "Correctness", if there is any, lies in using the right tool to get the right outcome.

Sometimes The MIT License works best.  Often when the project is some only narrowly marginally valuable spin in a commodity category, or some big firm's wants it commoditized.  Sometimes pretty strict proprietary terms work best.  Often when the software's truly innovative, practically valuable, and took lots of work.  Frequently enough, the best choice for some software shifts over time, as competitive circumstances change.  Finding the fair, productive choice is an engineering problem, not a multiple-choice question or a prompt to spout a creed.

Free and open agitprop helped set off a productive explosion.  They also outlasted their time, leaving lasting perceptual damage.  Their black-and-white, oddly essentialist view of software licensing helped polarize perception, build an audience, paint an enemy, and coalesce a movement.  Arguably, it took an extreme reaction to correct an extremely imbalanced market state, a dead end the industry hit in the first rounds of the consumer software market.

But the correction didn't set us down a flexible middle course chartered by hackers with appreciation for nuance.  It's reinforced a stark, absolutist, oddly limited view of a common but incomplete experience: young and commercially sheltered coders dealing almost entirely with dominant apps from domineering mega-vendors, on one hand, and open source, on the other.  No burgeoning gray area of independent software available on balanced terms, only speckles of black and white---open core with proprietary add-ons.  No experience of negotiation---fitting terms to circumstances---to speak of.  No hint from prevailing narrative to look for those missing parts of the overall industry picture.

We accepted that licensing mattered to our industry.  And we accepted that it was out of our hands, that `LICENSE` was the one file in our repos we couldn't be trusted to hack.  We lost our sense of what's possible.
