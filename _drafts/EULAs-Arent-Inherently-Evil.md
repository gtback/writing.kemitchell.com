Too many software developers simply cannot conceive that a dreaded "proprietary software license" could be reasonable, fair, and beneficial to users.  That they might rationally _prefer_ such terms to The MIT License for some code they use.

There is in fact _no reason_ such a thing cannot be.  It happens.  It's all about terms and circumstances.

Consider a deal on this outline:
- $n per year, annual term, renewing automatically
- binary and source delivered via Web download
- customer gets the current version plus any new ones released while they're still paying
- customer can keep using those versions, but not any newer ones, after they stop paying
- license covers running, patching, and running patched, but not sharing with others
- patches must be shared and licensed back to the developer
- seller guarantees the software will work as documented, won't come infected with malware, won't be full of security holes, won't containing unlicensed or plagiarized code
- support and maintenance via e-mail, with response-time service-level agreement (SLA)
- if the developer discontinues maintenance, license terms fall back to some standard free-of-charge license, agreed in advance

There's no inherent abuse here.  Depending on the software, the price, and the competition, it's just a good deal or a bad one.  Those who take the deal aren't "locked in" by some dark legal magic.  They _could_ become dependent on the software and the vendor, for lack of competition or a failure to diversify.  But not on an invisible hooks in the license.

Through the lens of free and open source ideology, of course, it's the road to serfdom and inevitable shitware.  Many "freedoms" are present, but some are not, and the matter is binary `AND`.  The customer's debased.  Cast down to copyright servitude.

But also, as we know, exceedingly unlikely to care.  Through the lens of actual lived experience, we see that what users reliably need and want, they get on this deal.

Of all the projects we use, we contribute meaningfully to only some tiny number.  We fork fewer still.  We tend to download software direct from where developers put it, not from our friends.  We don't like paying just to try something out, but once we're in, we immediately shift to worrying what we will or won't get for no money.  The question shifts from the software as such to all the work around it: support, maintenance, security, roadmap drive.

In all likelihood, users under this deal concede a whole lot of nothing.  Imperfect protections against problems they were unlikely to have.  In return, they get realistic benefits where they likely _will_ have need.  Consider:

- The customer gets source.  This is way more normal in B2B software deals than hackers tend to think.

- The customer can fix bugs and make improvements.  Better yet, they can dump them off on the seller.  What the customer could usually only hope for in the best case with open source---a timely response from a responsible person---they now get by right, under contract.

- If the seller drops the product, the customer can fork and maintain under fallback license, or hire someone else to.

- There's no "sustainability" mystery to leave unsolved and try not to think about.  The customer pays the developer.  Other would-be users face the same deal.

In short, instead of squelching the dev's interests in favor of the user's, the license agreement _aligns_ them.  The developer gets paid.  But it also takes responsibility:

- If the software is unreliable, the seller will have to spend more on support and maintenance to meet its obligations.

- If the seller under-invests in development, customers won't renew and the seller will lose revenue.

- If the software's riddled with bugs or vulns, customers can hold sellers responsible.  They don't have to count on best practices, professional ethos, free-for-open tools give-aways, or roving inspectorates funded by their competitors.

I write a lot of legal terms.  Legal terms have _no inherent value_.  Certainly no inherent _ethical_ value.  They matter only when applied, to move property and shape behavior.  They shape behavior by invoking sense of duty, staking reputation, and structuring incentives.  Usually backed by a reliable, independent legal system.

In many circumstances, software users and software developers will _both_ be better off under commercial terms, informed by practical outcomes and their probabilities, than under comparatively easy-to-grok, context-free terms at some intellectual clean-extreme, permissive open-source or full-lockdown proprietary.  Out in the world, when more is at stake than ethereal principle, that's often the more responsible, and the more ethical, way to go.

Legal terms are just tools.  Permissive, copyleft, and commercial are just kinds of them.  "Correctness", if there is any, lies in using the right tool to get the right outcome.  Sometimes The MIT License works best.  Often when the project has stiff, cheap competition.  Sometimes pretty strict proprietary terms work best.  Often when the software's truly new, very valuable, and lots of work.  Frequently enough, the best choice for some software shifts over time, as circumstances do.  Finding the fair, productive choice is an engineering problem, not a multiple-choice question or a prompt to spout a creed.

Free and open agitprop set off a productive explosion.  It also left lasting perceptual damage.  Its black-and-white, oddly essentialist view of software licensing was useful for polarizing perception, building an audience, painting an enemy, and coalescing a movement.  But it also reinforced a black-and-white, oddly license-obsessed view of limited experience: coders dealing almost entirely with dominant apps from domineering mega-vendors, on one hand, and open source, on the other.  There was little of the burgeoning gray area of independent software to be seen there, and little reason to look for what was missing.

At the same time we accepted that licensing mattered to our industry, we lost our sense of what's possible with it.
