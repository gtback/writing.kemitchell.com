Too many software developers simply cannot conceive that a dreaded "proprietary software license" could be rational, fair, and beneficial to users.  There is in fact _no reason_ such a thing cannot be.  They exist.

Consider a deal on this outline:
- $n per year, annual term, renewing automatically
- binary and source delivered via Web download
- customer gets the current version plus any new ones released while they're still paying
- customer can keep using covered versions after the contract term
- license covers running, patching, and running patched, but not sharing with others
- patches must be shared and licensed back to the developer
- seller guarantees the software will work as documented, won't come infected with malware, won't be full of security holes, won't containing unlicensed or plagiarized code
- support and maintenance via e-mail, with response-time service-level agreement (SLA)
- if the developer discontinues maintenance, license terms fall back to some standard free-of-charge license, agreed in advance

There's no inherent abuse here.  Depending on the software, the price, and the competition, it's just a good deal or a bad one.  Those who take the deal aren't "locked in" by some dark legal magic.  They _could_ become dependent the software, for lack of competition or bad customer strategy.  Not on invisible hooks buried in the contract.

Through the lens of free and open source ideology, of course, it's the road to serfdom and inevitable shitware.  Many "freedoms" are present, but some are not, and the matter is binary `AND`.  The customer's debased.  Copyright servitude.

But also, as we know, exceedingly unlikely to care.  Through the lens of actual lived experience, we see that what users reliably need and want, they get under this deal.

Of all the projects we use, we contribute meaningfully to only some tiny number.  We fork fewer still.  We tend to download software direct from where developers put it, not from our friends.  We don't like paying just to try something out, but once we're in, we immediately shift to worrying what we will or won't get for no money.  The question isn't the software as such, but all the work around it: support, maintenance, security, roadmap drive.

In all likelihood, users under this deal concede a whole lot of nothing.  Imperfect protections against problems they were unlikely to have.  In return, they get receive realistic benefits where they likely _will_ want or need.  Consider:

- The customer still get source.  This is way more common in B2B than hackers tend to suspect.

- The customer can fix bugs and make improvements.  Better yet, they can dump them off on the seller.  What the customer could usually only hope for in the best case with open source---a timely response from a responsible person---they now get by right, under contract.

- If the seller drops the product, the customer can fork and maintain under fallback license, or hire someone else to.

- There's no "sustainability" mystery to leave unsolved and try not to think about.  The customer pays the developer.  Other would-be users face the same deal.

In short, instead of _surrendering_ the developer's interests in favor of all the user's, the license agreement _aligns_ them.  The developer gets paid.  But it also takes responsibility:

- If the software is unreliable, the seller will have to spend more on support and maintenance to meet its obligations.  They'll get to keep less of their revenue as profit.

- If the seller under-invests in development, customers will lose motivation to renew.  The seller loses revenue.

- If the software's riddled with bugs or vulns, customers can hold sellers responsible.  They don't have to count on best practices, professional ethos, free-for-open tools give-aways, or roving inspectorates funded by their competitors.

I write a lot of legal terms.  Legal terms have _no inherent value_.  Certainly no inherent _ethical_ value.  They matter only when applied, to move property and shape behavior.  They shape behavior by invoking sense of duty, staking reputation, and structuring incentives.  Usually backed by a reliable, independent legal system.  If you've got one of those, _use it_ to solve your problems.  That's what it's there for.

In many circumstances, software users and software developers will _both_ be better off under commercial terms, informed by practical outcomes and their probabilities, than easier-to-grok, context-free terms at one extreme, be it permissive open-source or full-lockdown proprietary.  Out in the world, when more is at stake than ethereal principle, that's often the more responsible, and the more ethical, way to go.

Legal terms are just tools.  Permissive, copyleft, and commercial are just kinds of tools.  "Correctness", if there is any, lies in choosing the right tool to get the right outcomes.  Sometimes The MIT License works best.  Often when the project has stiff, cheap competition.  Sometimes, frankly, pretty strict proprietary terms do.  Often when the software's truly new and truly valuable.  Frequently, the best choice for a product shifts over time, as circumstances change.  Finding the fair, productive choice is an engineering problem, not a multiple-choice question or a prompt to spout a creed.

Free and open agitprop catalyzed an explosion in the early 2000s.  It also left lasting perceptual damage.  Its black-and-white, oddly essentialist view of software licensing was useful for polarizing perception, building an audience, and coalescing a movement.  But it also reinforced a black-and-white, oddly license-focused view of limited experience: coders dealing only with dominant apps from domineering mega-vendors, on the one hand, and open source on the other.  There was little of the burgeoning gray area of independent software to be seen there, and little reason to realize it was missing.

We lost our sense of what's possible in licensing.  We lost our sense
