I have signed the open [Letter in Support of Responsible Fintech Policy](https://concerned.tech) calling on members of the United States legislature to take a hard second look at blockchain lobby regulatory proposals.

Independence is the first privilege of a freelance professional.  Independence writes this blog.  But many out there will have noticed that I haven't posted anything blockchain since July of 2017, almost five years gao.  It's the one big, obvious topic I've denied myself, and not for lack of anything to say.

Five years ago, Bitcoin had just broken a thousand dollars.  Ethereum was just two years old.  The Securities and Exchange Commission's first investigation of a blockchain scheme, "The DAO", buzzed on [the blogs](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/07/25/DAO-Report-of-Investigation.html), including this one.  The "initial coin offering" wave was rising.

I advised a stable of promising blockchain clients.  Mine were the adults in the room: older, wiser veterans with life, business, and legal experience, focused on hard technical, policy, and institutional problems.  All were trying to make blockchains do real work.  All were trying to legitimize the concepts.  They weren't basking in reflected glow from their pitch decks.  They weren't pretending daring-do or unfathomable tech-magic exempted them from all known public policy.  They'd lived through the 2008 financial crisis as self-conscious, responsible adults.

I fired them all.

One by one, in careful e-mails, I ended our attorney-client relationships.  Referred them to other counsel, more eager to be "crypto lawyers".  Tried as I could to preserve personal relations, founded on deep respect.  I did what I could to explain, plain and honest, that it really wasn't them.  It was the whole "crypto space".  I'd had enough.  I was out.  Every blockchain client got an e-mail.

My income prospects tanked.  I was deeply relieved.  I still am.  I've taken some blockchain-_adjacent_ clients since --- all small, engineer-driven concerns doing actual cryptography on trickle-down dollars.  But nobody hocking chains, coins, or tokens.  I've lost track of all the new business I've turned down.  Gladly.

My pretenses against blockchain were then and remain now basically three: the work, the tech, and the crime.  In no particular order.

## The Work

As a lawyer, the work increasingly sucked.  Legal "greenfield" is fun, but we weren't alone out there.  Even ace clients increasingly sat across from jokers on on meaningful transactions.  Countless negotiations were derailed by rampant "incentives engineering" run amok.  Countless proposals, earnestly made at great time expense, should have been debunked at intro-business-law level.  Chaos in a new space tends to be high.  That's half the fun.  But I started getting the feeling that somehow, even relatively early in my law career, I wasn't playing in the right league.  A lot of basic homework clearly wasn't getting done.

Aven setting fools aside, many firms were yielding to temptation to issue a "coin" for quick, dumb capital.  Among the startup-founder precariat, the pull was massive.  You're worried about payroll on one hand.  You're sick at the thought of pounding pavement for pro finance on the other.  Suddenly, a new sign: exit right to Easy Street.

I greatly feared that my lawyer portrait would end up pasted into the market materials for some ICO I'd never heard about, perhaps as part of a template for fly-by-night scams.  To my knowledge, none of my actual clients ever did one while I was engaged.  But many a busines plan or compliance stragegy bent to accomodate those who did.  If the people wanted to mine for turds and hock them as treasures, there was money in pickaxes, cans, storage, and transportation.  The company stank, but it was a more honest living, by one step removed.

I don't judge.  In the right (wrong) circumstances, the only reasonable expectations is that even the stuanchest will heed incentive.  So I didn't judge.  But I did have a choice.  Five years of my prime down the line, I'm glad to have frittered them otherwise. I'm glad I wasn't associated.

## The Tech

More tragically, as a coder, it gutted me seeing attention, money, and brains evacuated out of promising scene after scene.  Second-wave peer-to-peer.  Privacy-first engineering.  User-friendly cryptography.  The fuel of the machine was technical credibility.  The marketeers were burning it like HMMWVs invading a flat, defenseless country, first one to the capital wins.  Many a promising project went from software to a white paper and back to software, only worse.  Some scenes were merely strip-mined of jargon and left bare.

In the process, some good coders---hell, even some unsuspecting grad students---got well deserved paying gigs, care of promoters with promises to fill.  But even ignoring the many worthy who didn't, a lot of those blessed by crypto cash ended up the way of [the HURD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd).  Five years is a lot of years in software land.  The sole inflexible requirement---speculative fundability---was reliably fulfilled, again and again.  Meaningful end-user value, not so much.  Good people went in, but worse work often came out.

Dominant chain nodes still convect surrounding airspace solving nothing.  Private-key crypto is still fraught and user-hostile.  The data stores remain slow and expensive, in the midst of a commodifying cloud war.  "Decentralization" is most often tactically vague, and when achieved in any meaningful specificity also promptly sacrificed to speed and convenience in the event of any meaningful adoption.  Privacy properties remain largely ill-conceived or merely performative aspirations.  The leaves off these tech trees not facing the money withered off, stunted, or simply got pruned away.  A lot of good devs who know better are grinding away on on some compromise.  The constraints they work under---or lack thereof---proved counterproductive.

[Signal](https://signalapp.com) announcing MobileCoin was a particularly debilitating moment.  Was real cryptography reverting to "crpto"?  I canceled a recurring donation.

Basic research is hard.  Industrialization is hard.  Achieving both at once is miraculous.  Allocating resources to call forth this whole process, under one guiding force, on the basis of _promotional_ talent, has again proved unwise.

Even the amalgamated, monetized want of thousands of eager speculators cannot will a meaningful innovation into being.  Crowdfunding the full projected cost of a hypothetical technology, then dumping it on a team in one gobsmacking lump, is the opposite of how we've learned to fund startups, and a long way off from how we've learned to contract for software development.  Have a budget, but tie installments milestones.  Ensure there's someone motivated to monitor, not a big collective action problem about it.  Scout team first, expect change on the business.

## The Crime

Finally, as a citizen, the worst was the mounting, obvious crime, the money that crime and fraud made, and the speed with which the money turned around on the system the crime and fraud at first evaded.  Perhaps this shouldn't have come as any great surprise.  A lot of the crime was securities fraud.  It was a short mutagenic jump from reinvesting in hype to reinforcing "community" to running a direct and self-conscious lobby operation, initially on the regulators, then over their heads to the pols.  Not to mention, meanwhile, any number of weak or striving backwater jurisdictions, wherever they could be found.

Nobody needs this blog to parade blockchain horribles or define the new slang for all the same old heists and scams ported to the new system.  Suffice to say it was obviously bad enough in 2017 that even a longtime computer programmer, who did research for a securities don in law school, who had a career plan derailed by international financial sanctions, could smell enough smoke to start running the other way.  I didn't want to be associatd.

## Bum Rush

Largely by repeating self-serving nonsense about how criminal use was negligible and securities laws somehow didn't apply---and finding plenty of lawyers willing to flatter the latter on paper, and eventually to work the litigation---the critical, interested mass bum rushed the regulators.  They got too far down, too quickly:  it's not coming back up, but heading all the way through us now, damage be done all the way.

That's where we're headed, if we cut blockchain an exception to rules that make sense, just for being blockchain, just to see where it goes under the loosest standard it can buy.  This in marked contrast to laws of the past clarifying that old scams with new tech---the mails, the wires---weren't fooling anyone, and could even do more damage.  Half of humanity is now online.  Being online now includes moving money.  Never have so many predators been gifted all necessary infrastructure to sift so many potential prey.

As becomes clear to anyone who thinks about the year-dates of the important legal decisions, the prospect of technology altering the balance of predator-prey power was hardly new upon our forebears.  The banking and money transfer laws were written to deny criminals those facilities, as they were and as they'd evolve.  The securities and fraud laws were given flexibility precisely to prevent the old scams from slipping through in new guises.  Where terms are loose, lawyers see their cue to look to the "policies"---the purposes behind the language, often stated in the statutes or inherited with the rules as judge-made law.  Those fundamental interests remain the same, and they don't include tolerating Main Street collateral damage because boosters have the pluck to irradiate characterization questions with new jargon and irrelevant tech trivia.  Where and how you keep the spreadsheet doesn't much matter to the agencies and their missions, nor should it.

I don't support cracking down on blockchain just for being blockchain.  A scene being riven with datajackers, confidence men, and bucket shop jockeys does not condemn others not so involved---be they true believers or earnest fools---by abstract association.  But neither do I support special privileges for those in denial or indifference to the unwelcome company they keep.  They way things are going is largely bad or laughable, not deserving of special grace.

Nevertheless, our federal representatives are sure to receive signal that the blockchain phenom has gathered resources unto itself and is ready to dance the DC shuffle.  But they should not mistake money spent for money earned.  That is missing half the balance sheet: all the many promises made and still outstanding.  And the fact the feds themselves printed the money, so much it had make up places to go.

Neither should Congress confuse the hype machine's striking capacity to suss out and summon real grievances---banking access, financial consolidation, transfer network improvement, predatory lending, monetary policy---with any capacity to address them.  The proper tools are known, but they aren't found in any "white paper".  They are found on parchment, in the Constitution, vested in Congress.  Due regulation, not aiding and abetting, is its call.  Tie yourselves to these interests with favors, you will stand with them when their debts come due, the hustle music stops, and full account is taken.
