I have signed the open [Letter in Support of Responsible Fintech Policy](https://concerned.tech) calling on members of the United States legislature to take a hard second look at blockchain lobby regulatory proposals.  I strongly agree with the letter.

As a freelance professional, independence is my dearest privilege.  Independence writes this blog.  But many out there will have noticed that I haven't posted anything blockchain since July of 2017, almost five years ago.  It's the one big, obvious topic I've denied myself, and not for lack of anything to say.

Five years ago, Bitcoin had just broken a thousand dollars.  Ethereum was barely two years old.  The Securities and Exchange Commission's first investigation of a blockchain scheme, "The DAO", buzzed on the blogs, including [this one](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2017/07/25/DAO-Report-of-Investigation.html).  The "initial coin offering" wave was rising.

I advised a stable of promising blockchain clients.  Mine were the adults in the room: older, wiser veterans with life, business, and legal experience, focused on hard technical, policy, and institutional problems.  They were trying to make blockchains do real work.  They were trying to operationalize the concepts.  They weren't basking in reflected glow from their pitch decks.  They weren't pretending daring-do or unfathomable tech-magic exempted them from all known public policy.  They'd lived through the 2008 financial crisis as self-conscious, responsible adults.

I fired them all.

One by one, in careful e-mails, I ended our attorney-client relationships.  Referred them to other counsel, more eager to be "crypto lawyers".  Tried as I could to preserve personal relationships, founded on deep respect.  I did what I could to explain, plain and honest, that it really wasn't them.  It was the whole "crypto space".  I'd had enough.  I was out.  Every blockchain client got an e-mail.

My income prospects tanked.  I was deeply relieved.  I still am.  I've taken some blockchain-_adjacent_ clients since --- all small, engineer-driven concerns doing actual cryptography on trickle-down dollars.  But nobody hocking chains, coins, or tokens.  I've lost track of all the new business I've turned down.  Gladly.

My pretenses against blockchain were then and remain now basically three: the work, the tech, and the crime.  In no particular order.

## The Work

As a lawyer, working in blockchain increasingly sucked.  Legal "greenfield" is fun, but we weren't out there alone.  Even ace clients increasingly sat across from jokers on on very meaningful transactions.  Countless negotiations were derailed by rampant enthusiast "incentives engineering" run amok.  Countless proposals, earnestly made at great time expense, should have been debunked at intro-business-law level.

Chaos in a new space tends to be high.  That's half the fun.  But I started getting the feeling that somehow, even relatively early in my law career, I wasn't playing in the right league.  A lot of basic homework clearly wasn't getting done.  A lot of transactions well into the dollar range for cost-effective litigation were getting done in tottering, precarious ways.

Even setting foolishness aside, many a firm was yielding to temptation to issue a "coin" for quick, dumb cash.  Among the startup-founder precariat, the pull was massive.  You're worried about payroll on one hand.  You're sick at the thought of pounding pavement for pro finance on the other.  Suddenly, a new sign: exit right to Easy Street.  This is assuming good-faith, earnest belief that they had something to deliver.  Some clearly wanted cash.

I had serious concerns that my lawyer photo would end up pasted into the market materials for some ICO I'd never heard about, perhaps as part of a template for mass-product, fly-by-night scams.  To my knowledge, none of my actual clients ever did one while I was engaged.  But many a busines plan or compliance strategy nonetheless bent to accommodate doing business with more of those who did.  If the people wanted to mine for turds and hock them as treasures, there was money in pickaxes, cans, storage, and transportation.  A more honest living, by one step removed.  But the work and the company still stank to high heaven.

I don't judge my clients.  I knew them too well.  In the right (wrong) circumstances, the only reasonable expectation of anyone is incentive-aligned.  But I was one more step removed, and I also had a choice.  Five years of my prime down the line, I'm glad to have frittered them otherwise.

## The Tech

More tragically, as a coder, it gutted me seeing attention, money, and brains evacuated out of promising scene after scene.

Second-wave peer-to-peer.  Privacy-first engineering.  User-friendly cryptography.  The fuel of the machine was technical credibility.  The marketeers were burning it like HMMWVs invading a flat, defenseless country, first one to the capital wins.  Many a promising project went from software to a white paper and back to software, only worse.  Some really cool ideas were more or less strip-mined of jargon, then left bare.

In the process, some good coders---hell, even some unsuspecting grad students---did get well deserved paying gigs, care of promoters with promises to fill.  I happen to really like some coders who got rich on one peak or another.  But even ignoring the many worthy who didn't, a lot of talent blessed with crypto mana duly went the way of [the HURD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Hurd).  Five years is a lot of years in software land.  The sole inflexible business requirement---speculative fundability---was reliably fulfilled, again and again.  But meaningful, competitive end-user value, not so much.  Good people went in, and worse seemed to come out.  The constraints imposed on them---or the lack thereof---proved counterproductive.

Dominant chain nodes still convect surrounding airspace solving nothing.  Private-key crypto is still fraught and user-hostile.  The data stores remain slow and expensive, in the midst of a commodifying cloud war.  "Decentralization" is most often enablingly vague, and when achieved in any specificity also promptly sacrificed to speed in the event of any adoption.  Privacy properties remain largely ill-conceived or mere lip service.  In short, the leaves off the tech trees not facing the money stunted, withered away, or got forcefully pruned off.  A lot of good devs who know better are grinding away on bad compromise technology.  [Signal](https://signalapp.com), which is damn good crypto work, announced MobileCoin support, and I stopped donating.

Basic research is hard.  Industrialization is hard.  Both at once is miraculous.  Allocating resources to call forth this whole process, under one guiding force, on the basis of _promotional_ talent, has again proved unwise.

Even the amalgamated, monetized want of thousands of eager speculators cannot will a meaningful innovation into being.  Crowdfunding the full projected cost of a hypothetical technology, then dumping it on a team in one gobsmacking lump, is the opposite of how we've learned to fund startups.  It's  a long way off from how we've learned to contract for software development.  Have a budget, but tie installments to milestones.  Ensure there's someone motivated to monitor progress, not a big collective action problem about it.  Scout team first, expect change on the tech, or even the fundamental business.

A certain measure of discipline is prerequisite for great achievement.  But a lack of discipline is attractive in its own compelling way, for people of very different aspirations.

## The Crime

As a citizen, the worst was the mounting, obvious crime, the money that crime and fraud made, and the speed with which the money turned around on the system the crime and fraud at first evaded.

Perhaps this shouldn't have come as such a surprise.  A lot of the crime was securities fraud.  It's a series of short mutagenic jumps from reinvesting in hype to reinforcing "community" to running a direct and self-conscious lobby operation, initially on the regulators, then over their heads to the pols.  And meanwhile weak or striving backwater jurisdictions, such as may be found.

Nobody needs this blog to parade blockchain horribles or define the new slang for all the same old heists and scams ported to the new system.  Suffice to say it was obviously bad enough in 2017 that even a longtime computer programmer, who did research for a securities don in law school, who had a career plan derailed by international financial sanctions, could smell enough sleaze to start turn around and walk away.  I didn't want to be associated.

## Flash Lobby

Walking off doesn't disappear the problem.

Largely by repeating self-serving nonsense about how criminal use was negligible, banking regulations were illegitimate, and securities laws somehow did not apply---and finding enough lawyers willing to flatter the latter, and eventually to work the litigation---the critical, interested mass of crypto players bum rushed the regulatory system. 

We've seen this play before.  Break the rules without acknowledgement, preferably, at first, in simple ignorance.  Emphasize immediate and hypothetical gains.  Downplay harms to the substantial minority, fully anticipated by the rulemakers.  Repurpose customers and business dependents as on-call political force.  Pressure the regulators to bless your current operations and settle past sins, securing a de facto pardon. In short, overwhelm the system, which is designed to be careful, with a sudden rush of mass and speed.  Collect you winnings and man your barricades before your tide rolls backs and public consequences catch up with you.

We've seen Uber and Lyft do it against carriage, employment, and insurance rules.  We've seen a million scooter companies follow suit, with children on the line.  We've seen actual children do it in "flash robs" looting stores in masse.  We see it now by a lone firm, an industry group, or a social crowd, but a mess of all of the above and individual interested parties, coalesced on the Web.

A belated reckoning with consequences is where we're headed, should we cut blockchain exceptions to rules that make sense, just for being blockchain, just to see what it can do under the best rules it can buy.  This in marked contrast to laws of the past clarifying that old skulduggery with newfangled tech---the mails, the wires---weren't somehow exempt from public protections, but could do even more damage.  Half of humanity is now online.  Being online now includes moving money.  Any one of us can scam any other one of us for cash.  Never have so many predators been gifted all necessary infrastructure to sift so many potential prey.

As becomes clear to anyone who really thinks about the dates on key statutes and legal decisions in financial services, antifraud, and securities, the prospect of technology altering predator-prey power dynamics was hardly new upon our forebears.  The banking and money transfer laws were written to deny criminals those facilities both as they existed then _and_ as they'd evolve.  The securities and fraud laws were given flexibility precisely to prevent the old scams from slipping through in new guises.  The harms they seek to prevent aren't defined in the terms of the modalities they regulate, but in terms of the harms themselves.

That means terms are often loose.  In California, fraud is "an intentional misrepresentation, deceit, or concealment of a material fact with the intention of depriving [someone] of property or a legal right or otherwise to cause [them] injury".  That's a not a bug or the law behaving un-law-like.  Where terms of the law are loose, lawyers take cue to look to "policies"---the purposes behind the language, often stated in the same statutes or inherited with the judge-made law.  Those fundamental interests remain the same today.  They don't include tolerating Main Street collateral damage because boosters have the pluck to answer serious questions with new jargon and irrelevant tech trivia.  Where and how you keep the spreadsheet doesn't matter to the agencies and their missions, nor should it.

I don't support cracking down on blockchain just for being blockchain.  A scene being riven with datajackers, confidence men, and Discord-adept bucket shop jockeys does not condemn others not so involved by abstract association, be they merely fools or holdout true believers.  But neither do I support special accommodations for those in denial or indifference to the unwelcome company they keep and proven harmful potential.  They way blockchain is going is largely bad, laughable, or both, not deserving of special leniency.  When your primary validated practical use case is regulations evasion, you do not win a special regulatory prize.

Nevertheless, our federal representatives are sure to take note that the blockchain phenom has gathered coherence enough to summon resources, some of which it is willing to spend at stat and national capitals.  But they should not mistake money to spend for money earned.  That is missing half the balance sheet: all the many promises made and still outstanding, all the many victims yet to be made whole, who may never be made whole.

Neither should Congress confuse the hype machine's capacity to summon real grievances---banking access, financial consolidation, transfer network improvement, predatory lending, monetary policy---with any capacity to address them.  The proper tools are known, but they aren't found in any "white paper".  They are found on parchment, in the Constitution, vested in Congress.  Due regulation, keeping market forces away from our necks and in our service, is its call, not aiding and abetting.  Tie yourselves to these interests with favors, you will stand with them when their debts come due, the hustle grinds down, and full account is taken.
