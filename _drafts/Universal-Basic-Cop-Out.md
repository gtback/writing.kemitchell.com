If universal basic income shows up on my ballot, I'll almost certainly vote for it.  But universal basic income has _no place_ in talk about "sustainability" in software.  We know how to pay people for good work in our industry.  Universal basic income is a cop-out for choosing not to make that happen.

Let's step out of the hall of mirrors for a moment.

Software development pays well.  The BLS median annual wage for a software developer in 2020 was $110,140.  The average for all jobs was $41,950.

Demand for software development is growing.  The 2020 BLS job outlook was 22% growth in 10 years.  The average for all jobs was just 8%.

Risky software ventures are well financed.  The National Venture Capital Association's 2021 yearbook puts software's "dominant" share of investment at $52 billion, or 31%.  Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, in second place, got only 17%.

Legal support for software business is strong.  We see strong deal flow in professional services, work for hire, acquisitions, and licensing.  Consultants, resellers, and marketplaces abound.

As a consequence, degree programs and coding bootcamps keep growing.  There's a stampede of people into the field.  The industry still can't seem to get enough.

The strongest justification for universal basic income is automation.  That used to mean machines doing jobs that people used to do.  Now it means machines running software.  Software is not the job getting automated.  Software is the job automating the other jobs.

Maybe someday automation will also gobble up more programmers than it creates.  Or maybe those jobs will be so productive, and require so much skill and training, that there will only be a few of them.  Right now, that seems far off.  About as far off as universal basic income.

The key feature of universal basic income as an idea in "sustainability" talk today is absolution for people who do not need universal basic income.  Rather than facing fair pay as a practical and ethical problem software needs to solve for itself, a hypothetical universal basic income transforms it into one instance of generalized, society-wide problem that government must solve, that really has nothing to do with us.  We keep doing what we're doing, without unwelcome disruption or inconvenience.  Those falling off the back of the party wagon get scooped up by the state, like the [broom wagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_wagon) at the Tour de France.

Meanwhile, universal basic income lets those _not_ doing well right now sit and wonder when this glorious egalitarian salvation will come to pass, whether they'll get back pay, and whether their contribution's sufficiently "basic" that "basic income" will suffice.  Politically, universal basic income tells them not to air their grievances at the industry, but to subsume them in a broader, pan-economic, mass-redistributive transfer-payment petition in the name of literally everyone on the wrong side of burgeoning inequality.  Don't solve your problem, solve everybody's problem.  Don't take it up with us, take it up with "the system".

If there is ever such a thing as a true "open source career path" in _making_ open source, rather than managing it for companies, the basic objectives will be the same as for any other work in the biz.  Establish a high market value for your work and your services by getting people to pay for them.  Develop assets and investments---from education, skills, and reputation to templates, tools, and libraries---that increase the marketable value of your work and services over time.

The clearest way to achieve this is a track record of direct exchange.  Perform good services for others who pay you well.  Charge meaningful prices for downloads, source code, or licenses.  Keep those trades as public and sharply outlined as possible, so others will see a clear link between value paid and what you did for it.

Conversely, avoid giving your work or services away without some clearly associated alternative path to compensation, lest the signal you send say your work is worth zero.  If you find yourself in an arrangement where fair trade is the reality, but not the obvious appearance, such as when developing permissively licensed code on somebody's payroll, make public recognition of that reality, by the person paying you, a non-negotiable part of your compensation.  Get a clear record that you weren't just spending your own time, working "for exposure" you do not need.

It's no excuse that projects remain speculative or unproven.  Mounds of capital pour out on high-risk software-venture slide decks every year.

It's no excuse that software itself isn't a product and can't sell.  Our industry is full of successful app and SaaS sole traders and microfirms.

It's no excuse that companies won't pay for software.  If that were the case, the big software firms would be dust, not leading the markets.

If you're doing good work without good pay, don't accept vague promises of economic justice raining down like promised mana from heaven.  It's nobody's job to save you.  We've got the casualties to prove it.  Go get what you're worth.  Get it now.
