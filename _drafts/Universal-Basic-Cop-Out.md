If universal basic income shows up on my ballot, I'll probably vote for it.  But universal basic income has _no place_ in talk of "sustainability" in software.  We know how to pay people in our industry.  Universal basic income is a cop-out.

Let's step out of the hall of mirrors for a second.

Software development pays well.  The BLS median annual wage for a software developer in 2020 was $110,140.  The average for all jobs was $41,950.

Demand for software development is growing.  The 2020 BLS job outlook was 22% growth in 10 years.  The average for all jobs was 8%.

Risky software ventures are well financed.  The National Venture Capital Association's 2021 yearbook puts software's "dominant" share of investment at $52 billion, or 31%.  Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, in second place, got only 17%.

Legal support for software business is strong.  We see strong deal flow in professional services, work for hire, acquisitions, and licensing.  Consultants, resellers, and marketplaces abound.

As a consequence, degree programs and coding bootcamps keep growing.  There's a stampede of people into the field.  The industry still can't seem to get enough.

The strongest justification for universal basic income is automation.  Machines are taking over jobs that people used to do.  Now it's machines running software taking jobs that people used to do.  Software is not the job getting automated.  Software is the job automating the other jobs.

Maybe someday automation will also gobble up more programmers than it creates.  The AI faithful await the coming revolution.  Or maybe programming jobs will be so productive, requiring so much skill and training, that there will only be relatively few of them to serve all mankind.  Right now, that seems far off.  About as far off as universal basic income.

The key feature of universal basic income as an idea in "sustainability" talk today is absolution for people who do not need universal basic income.  Rather than facing fair pay as a practical and ethical problem software needs to solve for itself, a hypothetical universal basic income transforms it into one instance of generalized, society-wide problem that government must solve for all.  Software winner keep doing what we're doing, without unwelcome disruption or inconvenience.  Those falling off the back of the party wagon will get scooped up by the state, like the [broom wagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_wagon) at a fancy bike race.

Meanwhile, universal basic income lets those _not_ doing well right now sit and wonder when this glorious egalitarian net across the financial pit of doom will come to pass, whether they'll get back pay, and whether a "basic income" will really reflect the value of their work.  Politically, universal basic income tells them not to air their grievances at the software industry, but to subsume them to a broader, pan-economic, mass-redistributive transfer-payment petition in the name of literally everyone on the wrong side of burgeoning inequality.  Don't solve your problem.  Solve everybody's problem.  Don't take it up with us.  Take it up with "the system".

If there is ever such a thing as a true "open source career path" in _making_ open source, rather than managing the making of it for companies, the basic objectives will be the same as for any other work in the biz.  Establish a high market value for your work and services by getting people to pay good prices for them.  Develop assets and investments---from education, skills, and reputation to templates, tools, and libraries---that increase the marketable value of your work and services over time.  Maybe even find some work that keeps paying when you stop working, like shares in a successful company or ownership of valuable IP.

The clearest way to success is a track record of direct exchanges.  Perform good services for others who pay you well.  Charge meaningful prices for downloads, source code, or licenses.  Keep those trades as public and uncomplicated as possible, so others will see a clear link between money paid and work done for it.  Your work.

Conversely, avoid giving your work or services away without any clear loss-leader play driving other compensation, lest the signal you send say your work is worth zero.  If you find yourself in an arrangement where a fair trade is the reality, but not the surface appearance, such as developing permissively licensed code on a payroll, make public recognition of that reality by the person paying you a non-negotiable part of your compensation.  Get a clear, public record that you weren't just spending your own time, working "for exposure" that you do not need.

It's no excuse that projects remain speculative or unproven.  Mounds of capital pour over high-risk software slide decks each year.

It's no excuse that software itself "isn't a product".  Our industry is full of successful app and SaaS sole traders and tiny firms.

It's no excuse that companies "won't pay for software".  If that were the case, the software industry would be a bone pile, not leading the markets.

If you're doing good work without good pay, don't accept vague promises of economic justice raining down like promised mana from heaven.  It's nobody's job to save you.  We've got the casualties to prove it.  Go get what you're worth.  Get it now.
