If universal basic income shows up on my ballot, I'll probably vote for it.  But universal basic income has _no place_ in "sustainability" talk for software.  We know how to get people paid in our industry.  Universal basic income is a cop-out.

Let's step out of the hall of mirrors for a second.

Software development pays well.  The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics median annual wage for a software developer in 2020 was $110,140.  The average for all jobs was $41,950.

Demand for software development is growing.  The 2020 United States Bureau of Labor Statistics job outlook was 22% growth in 10 years.  The average for all jobs was 8%.

Risky software ventures are well financed.  The National Venture Capital Association's 2021 yearbook puts software's "dominant" share of investment at $52 billion, or 31%.  Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, in second place, got only 17%.

Legal support for software business is strong.  We see strong deal flow in professional services, work for hire, acquisitions, and licensing.  Consultants, resellers, and marketplaces abound.

As a consequence, degree programs and coding bootcamps keep growing.  There's a stampede of people into the field.  The industry still can't get enough.

The strongest justification for universal basic income is automation.  Machines are taking over jobs that people used to do.  Today those machines get implemented in software.  Programming isn't the job getting automated.  Programming's the job automating so many other jobs.

Maybe someday software will eat its own tail and gobble up programmers father than it grows new ones.  The artificial intelligence faithful await the revolution.  Or maybe programming jobs will become so productive, requiring so much skill and training, that a relative few will suffice for all mankind.  Right now, that seems far off.  About as far off as universal basic income.

The key feature of universal basic income as an idea in "sustainability" talk today, the work that it does, is absolving people who do not need universal basic income.  Rather than facing fair pay as a practical and ethical problem the industry needs to solve for itself, a hypothetical universal basic income transforms our drama into one instance of generalized, society-wide problem that government must solve for everyone.  Software winners get to keep doing what we're doing, without unwelcome disruption, or even the inconvenience of addressing ways and means.  Those falling off the back of the blue-chip tech-sector party wagon will all be scooped up by the state, like a [broom wagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broom_wagon) at the back of a fancy bicycle race.

Meanwhile, universal basic income lets those _not_ doing well right now sit and wonder when this glorious egalitarian net across the financial pit of doom will come to pass, whether they'll get back pay, and whether a "basic income" will really reflect the value of their work.  Politically, universal basic income tells them not to air their grievances at the software industry, but to subsume them to a broader, pan-economic, mass-redistributive transfer-payment scheme-meme in the name of literally everyone on the wrong side of burgeoning inequality.  Don't solve your problem.  Solve everybody's problem.  Don't take it up with us.  Take it up with "the system".

If there is ever such a thing as a true "open source career path" in _making_ open source, rather than managing it for companies, the basic objectives will be the same as for any other work in the biz.  Establish a high market value for your work and your services by getting people to pay good coin for them.  Develop assets and investments---from education, skills, and reputation to templates, tools, and libraries---that increase the marketable value of your work and services over time.  Maybe even find some work that keeps paying when you stop working, like shares in a successful company or ownership of valuable IP.

The clearest path to success is a continuous track record of direct, high-value exchanges.  Perform good services for others who pay you well.  Charge meaningful prices for downloads, source code, or licenses.  Keep those trades as public and uncomplicated as possible, so others will read them as clear signs that others value what you do.  Enough to part with cash for it.

Conversely, avoid giving your work or services away without a clear loss-leader play linked to other compensation.  Otherwise, your signals read that your work is worth nothing.  If you find yourself in an arrangement where a fair trade is reality, but not the surface appearance, such as developing permissively licensed code on someone's payroll, make public recognition of that reality a non-negotiable part of your compensation.  Get clear, public recognition that you weren't just spending your own time, working "for exposure" that you do not need.  Get clear, public recognition that you are being paid, and not at some discounted charity-case rate.

It's no excuse that projects remain speculative or unproven.  Mounds of capital pour out on high-risk slide decks each year.  Investors happily place bets, the overwhelming majority of which by count will fail completely.

It's no excuse that good hacking alone "isn't a product".  Our industry is full of successful app and SaaS sole traders and tiny firms.  It has never been easier to buy good "product" help and tools.

It's no excuse that companies "won't pay for software".  If that were the case, the software industry would be a bone pile.  It's leading the market.

If you're doing good work without good pay, don't accept vague promises of newfangled fiscal justice just over the horizon.  You cannot live on economic vaporware.  Few in this industry won't at least pretend familiarity with employment, contracting, consulting, training, support, auditing, licensing, speaking, sponsorships, and acquisitions.

It's nobody else's job to save you.  We've got the casualties to prove it.

Get what you're worth.  Get it now.
