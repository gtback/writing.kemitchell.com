Too many software developers simply cannot conceive that a commercial software license---a dreaded "EULA"---could be reasonable, rational, fair, and beneficial.  For users and developers both.  There is in fact _no reason_ such a thing cannot be.  They exist.

Consider a deal on the following outline:

- $n per year, annual term, renewing automatically

- binary and source delivered via Web download

- customer gets the current version plus any released during the contract term

- license is perpetual --- customer can keep using covered versions after the contract term

- license covers running, patching, and running patched, but not sharing with others

- patches must be shared and licensed back to the developer --- a bit like copyleft, but upstream rather than down

- seller guarantees that will work as documented, not infected with malware, not full of security holes, not containing unlicensed or plagiarized code

- support and maintenance via e-mail, with response-time service-level agreement (SLA)

- if the developer discontinues maintenance, license terms fall back to some standard permissive, copyleft, or source-available license, as specified

There's nothing inherently abusive here.  Depending on the software, the price, and the competition, it's just a good deal or a bad one.

Those who take the deal aren't "locked in" by dark legal magic.  They _could_ become dependent, but that would turn on the software, the competition, and the customer's tech choices.  Not sharp hooks hidden in the contract.

Through the lens of open source ideology, of course, it's the road to serfdom.  Many "freedoms" are present, but some are not, and the matter is binary `AND`.  The customer, accordingly, is debased.  But also, practically, unlikely to care.  Through the lens of actual lived experience, we see that what users reliably need, they get.

Even for enthusiastic hacker types, "open source" mostly just _does_ mean free of charge, publicly available, and entitled to do what you know you shouldn't---take without giving back.  Of all the projects we use, we contribute meaningfully to only some tiny number.  We fork fewer still.  We tend to download software direct from where developers put it, not from our friends.

So in all likelihood, under the deal, for competitive software of meaningful value, we're conceding a lot of nothing.  In exchange for these concessions, we receive realistic offsetting benefits.

Consider:

- We still get source.  This is way more common in B2B than hackers tend to suspect.

- We can fix bugs and make improvements.  Better yet, we can foist them off on the seller.  What we could usually only hope for in the best case with open source---a timely response from a responsible person---we now get by right, under contract.

- If the seller drops the project, we can fork and maintain under the fallback license, or hire someone else to do so.

- There's no "sustainability" mystery to leave unsolved for our nightmares.  We benefit from the software, we pay the developers, they get money.  Other potential users face the same deal.

In short, instead of _surrendering_ the developer's interests in favor of users', the deal _aligns_ incentives.  So long as there _is_ a developer, living and hopefully engaged, their means and incentives are a factor that matters.

If the software is unreliable, the seller will have to spend more on support and maintenance to meet its obligations.  If the seller under-invests in development or maintenance, the customer will lose reason to renew for more years.  The customer doesn't need to rely on "best practices", free-for-open-source give-aways, or a roving foundation-based inspectorate funded by someone else for quality, security, or administrative comfort.  It can hold the seller accountable directly.  Which in turn prompts the seller to invest some in prevention.

I write a lot of legal terms.  It's a big part of my living.  Legal terms for private transactions have _no inherent value_.  Certainly no inherent _ethical_ value.

Deal terms gain value insofar as they affect property and guide behavior.  They change behavior by invoking a sense of duty, staking reputation, structuring incentives, or all three.  Usually backed by a reliable, independent court system.  If you live in a country with one of those, appreciate it.  _Use it._  Leverage the fact that it exists to solve your problems.

In many circumstances, software users and software developers will _both_ be better off under commercial terms, informed by practical outcomes and their probabilities, than absolutist terms at one extreme, be they permissive open-source or fully locked-down proprietary.  Out in the world, when more is at stake than disconnected, abstract principle, that's often the more responsible, and more ethical, way to go.  As is having users pay a fair price.

Legal terms are just a tool.  Permissive, copyleft, and commercial license terms are just kinds of legal terms.  "Correctness", if there is any, lies in the outcomes, not the means to them.  Sometimes The MIT License best reflects reality.  Sometimes, frankly, pretty strict proprietary terms do.  Often the fair, productive choices for a piece of software shifts over time, or deal by deal, as circumstances change or even just clarify.  Finding the fair, productive choice is an engineering problem, not a multiple-choice trivia question or a prompt to spout a creed.

Free and open agitprop catalyzed a breakthrough reaction in the early 2000s, but left behind lasting perceptual damage.  It left behind a deeply ingrained, black-and-white, oddly essentialist view of software licensing, useful for building a movement and an audiences---sound familiar, news fans?---but eventually stultifying.  That framing reinforced a too-common lived experience: consumers dealing with open source on one hand, dominant apps from domineering firms, on the other, and nothing of the burgeoning grey, plaid, striped, and polka-dotted indie communities between.  We lost our sense of nuance.  We lost our sense of what's possible.
