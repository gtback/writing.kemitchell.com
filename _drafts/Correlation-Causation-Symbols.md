title: Correlation and Causation Symbols
description: good shorthand versus bad shortcuts
---

I accidentally did myself a very good turn when it comes to taking notes.  Using `→` as shorthand for logical implication and causation, but `∝` (or `∝1/x`) for correlation, helps remind me to [distinguish the two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation).

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Symbol</th>
    <th>Unicode</th>
    <th>HTML Entity</th>
    <th>Vim Digraph</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th>→</th>
    <td>U+9192</td>
    <td><code>&amp;rarr;</code></td>
    <td><code>Ctrl+K -></code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>←</th>
    <td>U+2190</td>
    <td><code>&amp;larr;</code></td>
    <td><code>Ctrl+K <-</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>∝</th>
    <td>U+221D</td>
    <td><code>&amp;prop;</code></td>
    <td><code>Ctrl+K 0(</code></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

I recall using `∴` for _therefore_ and `∵` for _because_ in grade school.  I suppose the arrows used in computer science and formal logic eventually won out.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Symbol</th>
    <th>Unicode</th>
    <th>HTML Entity</th>
    <th>Vim Digraph</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <th>∴</th>
    <td>U+2234</td>
    <td><code>&amp;therefore;</code></td>
    <td><code>Ctrl+K .:</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>∵</th>
    <td>U+2235</td>
    <td><code>&amp;because;</code></td>
    <td><code>Ctrl+K :.</code></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

It probably helps that legible lines are easier and faster to write by hand than dots.  And that the causal directions of `→` and `←` are obvious.
