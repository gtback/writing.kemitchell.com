Take as a premise that American lawyers' bar associations, as a collective institution, currently fail to provide adequate business-law assistance at reasonable cost to a sufficient number of Americans.  Now suppose that each American, on average, donated $0.00039 to a special-purpose charity.  This would yield enough to hire one full-time lawyer for one year at $127,990, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' median paid for lawyers in 2021.  If the charity hired the lawyer and instructed them to advise on remedies and strategy to address the access-affordability problem, what would they say?

Any legal analysis would have to start with the fact that in every state, members of the bar association hold a monopoly on providing legal services for pay.  Since that monopoly is enshrined in state laws, it is exempt from broader provisions of the antitrust laws designed to preserve free competition.  The courts have been willing to enforce competition laws on bar associations in some particulars, striking down bar-established price lists and overbearing restrictions on lawyer advertising.  But competition laws do not provide any weapon against the monopoly as such.

More specifically, lawyers' monopolies are implemented in states lawyers requiring licensing and state laws criminalizing "unauthorized practice of law".  Reviewing unauthorized practice laws, our hypothetical counselor would have to advise that they are, as a rule, incredibly vague.  For example, in California:

> No person shall practice law in California unless the person is an active licensee of the State Bar. (Business and Professions Code §6125)

> Any person advertising or holding himself or herself out as practicing or entitled to practice law or otherwise practicing law who is not an active licensee of the State Bar, or otherwise authorized pursuant to statute or court rule to practice law in this state at the time of doing so, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in a county jail or by a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment.
>
> Upon a second or subsequent conviction, the person shall be confined in a county jail for not less than 90 days, except in an unusual case where the interests of justice would be served by imposition of a lesser sentence or a fine. If the court imposes only a fine or a sentence of less than 90 days for a second or subsequent conviction under this subdivision, the court shall state the reasons for its sentencing choice on the record.
>
> (Business and Professions Code §6126(a))

State statutes often don't define "practice of law" at all.  The American Bar Association---a professional interest group, not a licensing authority---publishes a draft model definition.  It's extremely broad and pervasively circular:

> The "practice of law" is the application of legal principles and judgment with regard to the circumstances or objectives of a person that require the knowledge and skill of a person trained in the law.

The practice of law is doing legal things that require knowing things lawyers know.  In other words, doing what lawyers do.  A perfectly self-referential protectionism.

> A person is <a class="note" id="presumed-reference" href="#presumed">presumed</a> to be practicing law when engaging in any of the following conduct on behalf of another:
>
> 1.  Giving advice or counsel to persons as to their <mark>legal</mark> rights or responsibilities or to those of others;
>
> 2.  Selecting, drafting, or completing <mark>legal</mark> documents or agreements that affect the <mark>legal</mark> rights of a person;
>
> 3.  Representing a person before an adjudicative body [for example, a court ---KEM], including, but not limited to, preparing or filing documents or conducting discovery; or
>
> 4.  Negotiating <mark>legal</mark> rights or responsibilities on behalf of a person.

Legal, legal, legal, legal.

Taken together, this rather circular lack of precision raises serious concerns about nearly any novel method of providing law-related service or information.  Normally, that would also raise questions about whether enforcing the law is even constitutional.

Voluminous scholarship, including many articles by lawyers in law journals, openly suspects this vagueness to be tactical.  After all, lawyers routinely advise on drafting terms and statutory language for better predictability.  That hasn't been achieved here.  Anyone looking to approach the lawyers' exclusive zone of play faces not just potential criminal consequences but also a broad zone of legal uncertainty approaching the line.  You are charging their ramparts, surrounded by their turf, and it's flooded with smoke.

There is an exception.  Perhaps a loophole.  To my knowledge, no state monopoly on legal services prevents people doing their own legal work, at least outside of court.  You can't offer to do other people's legal work, but you can do your own.

## Notes

<h3 id="presumed">“Presumed”</h3>

When something's "presumed" in law, that means that's the conclusion that sticks by default.  It's a bit like the house rule in blackjack that the dealer wins any tie.

Under the ABA language, if you're doing one of the things on the list, it's on you to show you're _not_ practicing law, rather than on the other side to show you _are_.
