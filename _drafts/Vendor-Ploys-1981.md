The second chapter of Joseph Auer and Charles Harris's _Computer Contract Negotiations_, copyright 1981, is called "Popular Vendor Ploys".  See if these ring a bell:

1.  We don't need to write that down.  You can trust me.

    Eternal.  If you can agree to it over the phone or over e-mail, you can put it in a contract.

    Consider who will be left without language to point to if the commitment isn't honored, but also left out of the terms.

    Consider how long the other side is willing to guarantee they'll stick around and stay available to explain all the deal points that aren't in the file copy.

2.  You're getting our best price.

    There is a legal legal term for this thing, the "most favored nation" clause.  Vendor lawyers usually fight it, and pretty strongly.  Big-money investors and potential corporate acquirers often demand a list of contracts with these kinds of clauses as part of due diligence.

3.  Here's everything you need for one low payment.

    "Land and expand" potential is [on my standard questionnaire for salespeople referring sales contracts my way](https://github.com/kemitchell/sales-support-deal-intro-questionnaire/blob/main/questionnaire.md#opportunity).

4.  Sign now.  We've got a price increase coming.

6.  Price increase is coming.

7.  Try it. You'll like it.

8.  Hot Button

9.  Form Contract

10. I'll have to get any changes approved.

11. Trade-In Credit

12. Right to Substitute (and Other Shell Games)

13. The GSA won't let us do that for you.

14. We can't do that. It would set a precedent.

15. That's not the way we figured the deal.
