[This episode of "Computer Chronicles" on shareware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aDXV10-5lo), broadcast San Mateo Community College's KCSM TV station in 1988, is highly recommended viewing for any students of "open" software business models who came online after the major transition from BBS- to Web-based distribution.
