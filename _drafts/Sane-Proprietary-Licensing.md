Many open software developers, especially younger ones, share a cartoon, black-and-white view of proprietary software licensing.  On one side, there's the pure white bliss of permissive open terms---MIT, BSD, Apache 2.  On the other side, there's the yawning, ink-black pit of proprietary despair.

As they see it, proprietary licensing is always abusive.  Restrictive.  Expensive.  Designed to lock in.  It's all the worst stories everyone's ever heard about Oracle in the '90s, rephrased as legal rules, packed into an inscrutable tome of dense fine print.  Nominally, you're a customer, transacting with a vendor.  Actually, you're [indentured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indenture).  You license the software.  The vendor owns you.

It's good fire-and-brimstone, if what you want is to set up a big altar-call, come-to-open-source moment down the line.  The worse proprietary's made out to be, the more open sounds like salvation.  But it is not the truth.  Software customers know better, and get better terms, all the time.
