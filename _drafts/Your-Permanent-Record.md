Bob has an opinion.  His view is ill-considered.  Affecting policy, it would cause substantial harm.  Copious evidence, readily available from credible, public sources, contradicts all his premises.  Take all this as given.  Bob is wrong.  Very wrong.

You help Bob publish his opinion online.  Does this help or hurt Bob?  Does it help or hurt Bob's position, as a view people other than Bob might hold or adopt?

Realistically, it depends.  On Bob and his opinion.  On how you help him to publish.  On other means of publishing available to Bob.  On when we ask the question.

We could imagine perfectly plausible circumstances in which helping Bob publish his opinion online actually hurts both Bob and his view.

Suppose we run a mass-market blogging platform.  Bob signs up under his own name.  He makes a post expressing his opinion.  He goes on at length.  He's emphatic, disdaining better supported alternatives.  He's abrasive, petulant, combative, and accusatory.  Even for those already sharing Bob's opinion, or those who might benefit from sharing it, Bob's post is no use.

Nobody really pays attention to Bob's post.  He tries to promote it, but gains no traction.  Bob found publishing cathartic.  But that's about it.

The post languishes for years.  But it remains online, under Bob's name.  Nobody's much interested in Bob's opinion, but some are interested in Bob, for other reasons.  Folks researching Bob online find his post.

Bob may continue to hold the view, and leave the post as it stands.  He may delete it, but find it's archived by others, such as the [Wayback Machine](https://wayback.archive.org).  Background-check and screening services continue to index it.  It's now a permanent part of Bob's public record.

Several countries have adopted laws that give people the right to delete data from when they were children.  As societies, we don't want childish missteps haunting adults until they die.  As adults, we understand childhood.  But we'd rather simply be rid of the data than rely on everyone to discount it appropriately.

Some countries go further, giving adults the right to wipe their tracks, too.  Expungement removes old entries from criminal records.  Rights to erasure remove old data from private records and the public Web.
