If you'd be interested in taking part in a fundraiser where a Zoom panel of open licensing lawyers answers questions from folks making donations for Ukraine, please [send me an e-mail at kyle@kemitchell.com](mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com?subject=Ukraine%20Benefit) to let me know.  If there's interest, we can make it happen.

A few thoughts, nothing set in stone:

- We'd likely set a donation minimum, but leave exact amounts up to donors.

- We'd ask donors to tell us which fine organization they donated to before giving their questions.

- Q&A would happen via public Zoom call.  No secrets!

- Legal clinic rules.  [Answers wouldn't be formal legal advice.](https://notlegaladvice.law)

I already have a couple talents lined up for the panel.  Folks care.
