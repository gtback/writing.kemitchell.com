There is an amazing amount of seedy fitness marketing on the Internet.  Here's the workout crap I've bought over the last several years that actually worked well for me, doing calisthenics and weenie gymnastics-style training at home.

To give a sense, here are some of the exercises I've enjoyed that required at least some equipment:

- Ab Rollouts, with Wheel and Rings
- Chin-Ups and Pull-Ups, on Bar and Rings
- Dips, on Bars and Rings
- L-Sits, on Bars and Rings
- Rings Push-Ups
- Rings Rows

### Khanh Trinh Pull-Up Bar

I am 6 feet, 2 inches or 188 centimeters tall.  I started out with a very inexpensive "power tower" combining pull-up bar and dip station.  That worked great for dips, but wasn't tall enough for me to hang from the bar with my body straight and my feet off the floor.  As a result, though I convinced myself I was working the full pull-up range of motion, in reality I failed to develop strength in the bottom range, and never really achieved good form with shoulder blades pulled fully back and fully down.

The [Khanh Trinh bar](https://khanhtrinhvn.com/products/kt1-1520-kt-folding-stand-frame-for-tall-or-big-users/) was far more expensive, and a bit of a leap of faith.  It shipped in a huge box, and weighed quite a bit.  But I've found their heavier model plenty tall and sturdy for my needs.  I replaced some of the bolts used for assembly with hitch pins, making it much easier to take down and set up again.

I have experienced rust on the tubes, both inside and on the outside where paint has worn away or chipped.  The factory does _not_ coat or paint the insides of the tubes.  When I know rain is coming, I try to bring the bar indoors.

Other folks seem to like pull-up bars that fit into interior door frames.  I've tried those in the past, much success, due to the size and construction of my doors.  It was clear none of the doors at my current place would work with such a bar.

### Gymnastic Rings

I hang these from the pull-up bar.  That opens up rings pull-ups, rings push-ups, rings dips, rings rows, rings rollouts, and a ton of other movements.

I strongly recommend wood rings.  I bought a set very cheap online.  The rings themselves have been fine, but one of the soft-metal buckles on the included straps failed.  I now use heavy-duty, all-weather straps with steel cam buckles.  Any good straps long enough to reach the ground, with secure buckles that are easy to adjust will do.  There's no need for rings-specific straps.

I also have a set of larger-diameter "CrossFit"-style rings.  My hands are relatively large, and I found them more comfortable for some exercises.  I've also read that they can make some things easier, like learning false grip.  But I've mostly put them aside and stuck with the standard-size rings.

### Rubberbanditz Exercise Bands

There are many companies offering these now.  I can only speak for the brand that I bought.  I currently have their [41-inch orange, red, black, purple, and green bands](https://www.rubberbanditz.com/41-in-resistance-band/).

These have been incredibly useful for adding assistance to movements I can't quite do yet.  It's also possible to gradually reduce assistance by moving to thinner bands over time.

The small orange band doesn't offer much assistance on its own.  But I've found it useful in combination with other bands, to create a step between.

As a caveat, the bands provide more assistance the longer they are stretched.  So, for example, a band will give more assistance at the bottom of a pull-up than at the top.  Especially with pull-ups and dips, this means the band helps most where you might be weakest, leading to a big jump in difficulty from doing the movement with the lightest band assistance to doing the movement without any band at all.

The bands can also be used to add resistance to bodyweight exercises like push-ups.

### Door Anchor

Basically, a strap with a stop on one end and a loop on the other that you can throw over the top of an interior door, which you then close, clamping the strap in the doorjam.  The loop then becomes an anchor point through which you can loop rubber bands.

You could make one of these yourself with webbing or a strap.  If you buy, I can't imagine brand really mattering.

I use this to add band assistance to hamstring curls, natural leg extensions, and ab rollouts.

### Hamstring Curl Stick

Akin to the door anchor, but with a padded rod for ankles, which goes _beneath_ a closed door.

I have only used this for hamstring curls.  But that has been a very rewarding exercise.  A few months in, I am still working up to doing the movement without band assistance.

### Ab Wheel

A stick with a wheel in the middle and handles on the sides.

I experienced a steep jump in difficulty progressing from using the ab wheel on my knees to using it with straight legs.  Band assistance from the door anchor is very helpful here.

I also find it very helpful to set myself up a measured distance from a wall or other stop that I can bump with the wheel at full extension, marking full range of motion.

### Extra Long, Thick Yoga Mat

I appreciated finding a longer yoga mat that also had more padding.  I use mine not just for stretching, but as a pad beneath my knees and legs for hamstring curls and natural leg extensions.

### Keypad Timer

I've benefited from having a countdown timer that I can set to an exact number of seconds for static holds like planks, rings support position, and l-sits.

I have bought this one online at least three times.  Each one was branded a different way.  I like that it remembers the last setting, so it's very easy to run again for the same amount of time.
