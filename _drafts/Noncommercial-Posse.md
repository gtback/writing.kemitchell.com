We want those making bank pay the devs whose work they depend on.  That's the transitive property we're missing in our industry.  At the same time, there are a bunch of potential users---tinkerers, students, charities---who can't or shouldn't pay, and shouldn't be locked out.  Either way, working in the open makes software better.

The direct path forward is clear.  Develop code in the open.  License it for noncommercial use free of charge.  Sell licenses for commercial use to business.

Don't pretend that AGPL is a noncommercial license.  Don't pretend that payments for software are donations, ad spend, or tech support fees.  Don't pretend software is the only "content industry" online where everything must be black and white, totally open and permissive or totally closed and locked down.

Could charging business users for open software ever feel like a movement?

Sure, with enough projects taking the leap.  But a leap it would be.  It's easy to imagine a software industry with a norm of fair pay.  It's harder to imagine how we get there from where we stand now.

At least as pitched so far, allowing noncommercial use for free and charging for commercial use marks a pretty lonesome road.  It means veering off from the pack, where there are lots of good feelings and gratuitous Internet points for more MIT-, BSD-, and Apache-licensed work.  But even beyond individual daring-do, noncommercial licensing means leaving behind the _collective_ project of amassing ever more MIT-, BSD-, and Apache-licensed code for devs to play with.  It's not just that your own project is going its own way.  It's that you're no longer part of the meta project called "FOSS".

Devs care about this meta project not so much because it's a big, sparkly idea, but because of their experience.  When a dev finds an MIT-licensed project, they can make more MIT-licensed projects with it.  When a dev finds a GPL-licensed project, they can make more GPL-licensed projects with it.  They don't even have to tell the prior dev what they're doing, much less beg or bargain for permission to do it.

This isn't reciprocity.  There's no guarantee good comes back around to the right people.  And there are all kinds of problems with keeping devs in the dark about who's using their code.  But growing the pile of MIT-, BSD-, and GPL-licensed projects hasn't been one of them.  There's a nice closed loop from experiencing "permissionless" development to making more FOSS and feeling good about that.

Contrast noncommercial licensing.  If a dev finds a noncommercial project under terms like [PolyForm](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0) or [Prosperity](https://prosperitylicense.com), they can't really make more noncommercial projects with it, assuming they _also_ want to charge for commercial use.  Selling licenses is a business model.  Business models are "commercial".  So the dev has to start by buying a license for the project they found.  They can't get started until they do.

This isn't "permissionless".  It's closer to "permission first".  Socially, that makes it hard to like feel you're on a team with other noncommercial developers.  The more other noncommercial developers succeed, the more often you find yourself across from them, buying or negotiating licenses so you can get started.

The answer _isn't_ that noncommercial devs should give other noncommercial devs a free pass.  When a business makes money, the devs they rely on should make money, too.  That's the transitive property we want in our industry.  But that can't happen if we gum up the process of software reuse with flaky, unstructured license negotiations as step zero.

We want developers, including developers trying to make money, to take software they find and run with it.  We don't want a regression on the permissionless development experience.  But if and when devs do make money, we want them paying their deps and their toolmakers.  Plant, but share the harvest.

## From the Top

We want to those making money pay the devs behind work they rely on.  At the same time, there are a bunch of users who can't pay or shouldn't pay, and shouldn't have to.  Either way, working in the open makes better software.  The clearest way to structure all that is open code, a free noncommercial license, and paid licenses for businesses.

Trouble is, as an industry, we're currently reproducing a mindset that pukes at anything not absolutely permissive-open or proprietary-closed.  That pushes projects to one extreme or the other, where many end up less good for less people than they could be, and others bewitch their developers into ritualistic economic and emotional self-sacrifice.

To overcome that mindset and its consequences, we need to run in a pack, not as lone wolves.

Upshot:  There are situations where we want commercial use to start out free, but transition to paid when the project makes money. Not pay-up-front, but pay-when-paid.
