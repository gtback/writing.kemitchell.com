On May 14, 2021, I paid the absurd sum of $433 United States dollars for a computer keyboard.  Specifically, an IBM Model F reproduction from [modelfkeyboards.com](https://modelfkeyboards.com).  The specs:

- Model F62 ("Kishsaver")
- Black Case
- Regular, Unprinted Keys
- Standard ANSI/ISO Layout
- Plus Repair Kit

Essentially, a 60% keyboard with [capacitive buckling spring switches](https://patents.google.com/patent/US4118611A/en) running QMK firmware.

The keyboard shipped nearly a year later, on May 19, 2022.  It arrived at my home in Oakland, California on May 27, 2022.  A long wait.

A few thoughts:

The instructions for installing the keys are both very important and very poorly done.  Key points:

1.  You _must_ stand the keyboard on its edge, top side down, when installing the keys.  The internal springs must fall toward the top of the keyboard as you install the keys.

2.  Keys that sit over two switch barrels---one with a spring, one without---need an included white insert slotted into the vacant barrel.  The insets will only sit flush in the correct orientation.
