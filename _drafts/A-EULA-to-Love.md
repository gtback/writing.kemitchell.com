I am constantly dismayed by the deep and lasting effects of early open source agitprop.  Countless software developers doubtless cannot conceive that a paid software license---a dreaded "EULA"---could be reasonable, rational, fair, and mutually beneficial.  There is in fact _no reason_ such a thing cannot exist.  They do exist.

Consider a deal on the following outline:

- Price: $n per month or per year

- Term: month-by-month or annual, automatically renewing

- Scope: any version made publicly available during the term

- Delivery: binary and source code

- License Term: "perpetual", i.e. if a version comes in scope, you can use it forever, even after termination

- License Permission: run, patch, run patched

- License Condition: patches shared and licensed back to the developer

- Warranties: responsibility for quality, lack of malware, lack of intellectual property problems, security

- Support and Maintenance: standard scope with response-time service-level agreements

- Sunset: if the developer discontinues maintenance, license falls back to some standard permissive, copyleft, or source-available license, as specified

There's nothing inherently abusive here.  Depending on the software and the price, it's either a good trade or a bad one.  No one's inherently forced to take that trade, and if they do, they aren't "locked in" by some dark legal magic, except for the next month- or year-long term, as the terms may be.
