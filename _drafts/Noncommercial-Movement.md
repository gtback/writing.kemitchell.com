We want those making bank to pay the devs they depend on.  That's the transitive property we're too often missing in software now.  At the same time, there's a bunch of potential users---tinkerers, students, charities---who can't or shouldn't pay, and shouldn't be locked out.  Paid or free, working in the open makes the software better.

The direct path forward here is clear.  Stop pretending AGPL is noncommercial.  Stop passing payments off as ad spend, support fees, and donations.  Stop insisting that software is the only "online content industry" where things must be black and white, completely open-permissive or totally closed and locked down.  Develop code in the open.  License it free for noncommercial use.  Sell licenses for commercial use to businesses.  Pay your bills and spend more time on the software.

Charging business users acknowledges the reality that broadly reusable software can't and shouldn't be left to the idle rich, massive firms, and academics.  Hard-nosed economic realism sees this clearly.  But could charging business users for open code ever feel like a _movement_?

At least as pitched so far, charging for business use of open code marks a fairly lonesome road.  But beyond even individual daring-do, noncommercial licensing means leaving the _collective_ project of amassing ever more do-whatever code for fellow devs to play with.  It's not just that your own project goes its own way.  It's that you're no longer rowing for the bigger meta project called FOSS.

Devs care about this meta project not so much because it's a big, sparkly idea, but because of lived experience.  First and foremost, FOSS is a lot of free stuff, a shopping spree, which gives a leg up.  But there is also a collective experience.  When a dev finds an MIT-licensed project, they can make more MIT-licensed projects with it.  When a dev finds a GPL-licensed project, they can make more GPL-licensed projects with it.  They don't even have to tell the prior dev what they're doing, much less beg or bargain for permission to do it.

This isn't reciprocity.  There's no guarantee good comes back around to the right people, or in the right proportions.  And there are all kinds of problems with keeping devs in the dark about who's using their code.  But growing the pile of MIT-, BSD-, and GPL-licensed software hasn't been one of them.  There's a nice closed loop from experiencing "permissionless" FOSS to making more FOSS and feeling good about that.

Contrast noncommercial licensing.  If a dev finds a noncommercial project under terms like [PolyForm](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0) or [Prosperity](https://prosperitylicense.com), they can't really make more noncommercial projects with it, assuming they _also_ want to charge for commercial use.  Selling licenses is a business model.  Business models are "commercial".  So the dev has to start by buying a license for the project they found.  They can't get started until they do.

This isn't "permissionless".  It's closer to "permission first".  Socially, that makes it hard to like feel you're on a team with other noncommercial developers.  The more other noncommercial developers succeed, the more often you find yourself across from them, buying or negotiating licenses so you can get started.

The answer _isn't_ that noncommercial devs should give other noncommercial devs a free pass.  When a business makes money, the devs they rely on should make money, too.  That's the original point here.  But nobody's getting paid if we gum up the process of software reuse with flaky, unstructured license negotiations as step one for every project.

We want developers, including developers trying to make money, to take software they find and run with it.  We don't want a regression on the permissionless development experience.  But if and when devs do make money, we want them paying their deps and their toolmakers.  Plant, but share the harvest.
