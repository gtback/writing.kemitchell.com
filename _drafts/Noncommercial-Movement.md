We want those making bank to pay the devs whose work they build on.  That's the transitive property we need and want for foundational work in our industry.  At the same time, there's a bunch of potential users---tinkerers, students, charities---who can't or shouldn't pay, and shouldn't have to.  Paid or free, working in the open makes better software.

The direct path forward here is clear.  Stop pretending AGPL is noncommercial.  Stop passing software fees off as ad spend, support payments, or gratuitous donations.  Stop insisting that software is the only "content industry" known to man where things must be black and white, completely open-permissive or totally closed and locked down.  Develop code in the open.  License it free for noncommercial use.  Sell licenses for commercial use to businesses.  Pay your bills, stop starving, and spend more quality time on your software.

Charging business users acknowledges that broadly reusable software can't and shouldn't be left to idle rich gentlemen-hackers, massive firms, heavily capitalized startup companies, and academics.  Hard-nosed economic realism sees this clearly.  But could charging business users for open code ever feel like a _movement_?  Could inducing this change in the industry be _exciting_?

At least as pitched so far, charging for commercial use of open code marks a fairly lonesome road.  There is not so many back-slaps or social media points as for more MIT-, BSD-, or even GPL-licensed code.  But setting individual daring-do aside, noncommercial licensing means leaving the _collective_ project of amassing ever more do-whatever code for fellow devs to play with.  It's not just that your project goes its own way.  It's that you're stepping out of the meta project known as FOSS.

Devs care about this meta project not so much because it's a big, sparkly idea, but because of association with direct, lived experience.  First and foremost, FOSS is a lot of free stuff, a shopping spree, a highly empowering experience.  But there is also a collective, social aspect.  When a dev finds an MIT-licensed project, they're welcome to make more MIT-licensed projects with it.  When a dev finds a GPL-licensed project, they can make more GPL-licensed projects with it.  They don't even have to tell the prior dev what they're doing, much less beg or bargain for permission.

This isn't reciprocity.  There's no guarantee good turns come back around to the right people, or in the right proportions.  And there are all kinds of problems with keeping devs in the dark about who's using their code.  But growing the pile of MIT-, BSD-, and GPL-licensed software hasn't been one of them.  There's a nice closed loop from experiencing "permissionless" FOSS to making more FOSS and feeling good about that.

Contrast noncommercial licensing.  If a dev finds a noncommercial project under terms like [PolyForm](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0) or [Prosperity](https://prosperitylicense.com), they can't really make more noncommercial projects with it, assuming they _also_ want to charge for commercial use.  Selling licenses is a business model.  Business models are "commercial".  So the dev has to start by buying a license for the project they found.  They can't get started until they do.  The cycle is broken.

This isn't "permissionless".  It's closer to "permission first".  Socially, that makes it hard to like feel you're on a team with other noncommercial developers.  The more other noncommercial developers succeed, the more often you find yourself _across_ from them, buying or negotiating licenses so you can get started.

The answer _isn't_ that noncommercial devs should give other noncommercial devs a free pass.  When a business makes money, the devs they rely on should make money, too.  That's the purpose here.  But nobody's getting paid if we gum up the process of software reuse with flaky, unstructured license negotiations as unavoidable step one.

We want developers, including developers trying to make money, to take software they find and run with it.  We don't want a regression on the permissionless development experience.  But if and when devs do make money, we want them paying their deps and their toolmakers.  Take these seeds and sow them freely, but share the harvest that you reap.

We want to give tinkerers, students, and charities free use.  We could do this like big companies, with discount and academic licensing programs.  But we're not big companies, so we "automate" it in license terms.  Noncommercial license forms are born.  [PolyForm Noncommercial](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0).

We accept that putting code online, people are going to try it out and get away with that.  Even at work, when our terms say noncommercial.  We could handle this like big companies, with abbreviated "trial" negotiations.  But we're not big companies, so we "automate" it in license terms.  Free-trial license forms are born.
