We want those making bank to pay the devs whose work they build on.  That's the transitive property we need for foundational work in our field.  At the same time, there's a bunch of potential users---tinkerers, students, charities---who can't or shouldn't pay, and shouldn't be shut out.  Paid or free, open development makes better software.

The direct path forward here is clear.  Stop pretending AGPL is a noncommercial license.  Stop passing fees off as ad spend, support payments, and donations.  Stop insisting that software must be black or white, completely open and unrestricted or completely closed and locked down.  Develop code in the open.  License it free for noncommercial use.  Sell permission for commercial use to businesses.  Pay your bills, hire good help, and spend more quality time on your software.  Make your project's self-sufficiency---if you must, its "sustainability"---a competitive selling point.

Charging business users acknowledges that broadly reusable software should not and cannot be left to idle-rich gentlemen-hackers, megafirms, heavily capitalized startups, graduate students, and martyrs.  But could charging business users for open code ever feel like a _movement_?  Could inducing a change in the industry, in the name of hard-nosed economic realism, be _fun_?

At least so far, charging for commercial use means turning off Main Street down a fairly lonesome road.  There aren't so many back-slaps or gratuitous social media points as for MIT-, BSD-, or even GPL-licensed releases.  But besides individual daring-do, noncommercial licensing means leaving the _collective_ project of amassing ever-larger global stockpiles of do-whatever code.  It's not just that your project goes its own way.  You're no longer part of the greater meta project known as FOSS.

Devs care about this meta project not so much because it's a big, sparkly idea, but because they associate it with positive personal experiences.  First and foremost, to most of the people involved, FOSS is a lot of free stuff, a shopping spree, a power-up---especially for newish devs.  But there is also a collective, social overlay.  When a dev finds an MIT-licensed project, they're welcome to make more MIT-licensed projects with it.  When a dev finds a GPL-licensed project, they can make more GPL-licensed code.  They don't even have to tell the prior dev what they're doing, much less ask for permission.  They're invited to do just as they have seen done.

This isn't reciprocity.  There's no guarantee that good turns come back around to the right people, or in the right proportions.  And there are all kinds of problems with keeping devs in the dark about who's using their code.  But growing the pile of MIT-, BSD-, and GPL-licensed software hasn't been one of them.  There's a nice closed loop from experiencing "permissionless" FOSS development to developing more FOSS and feeling good about that.  Even if, as is usual, you primarily contribute to your project alone.

Contrast noncommercial licensing.  If a dev finds a noncommercial project under terms like [PolyForm](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/noncommercial/1.0.0) or [Prosperity](https://prosperitylicense.com), they can't really make more noncommercial projects with it, assuming they _also_ want to charge for commercial use.  Selling licenses is a business model.  Business models are "commercial".  So the dev has to start by buying a license or avoiding the code.  They can't kick off their project until they do one or the other.

This is closer to "permission-first" than "permission-less".  The cycle of invitation and imitation is broken.  Socially, that makes it hard to like feel you're on a team with other noncommercial developers.  After all, the more other noncommercial developers succeed, the more often you'll find yourself _across_ from them, buying licenses so you can get started.  Your role there is customer, even if you actually have much more in common with the sellers, as upstarts trying to grow independent projects, than with MIT code maintainers on some larger company's payroll.

How do we complete this broken cycle for noncommercial devs?  Does commercial licensing have to mean a regression on the permissionless development experience?

The answer _isn't_ that noncommercial devs should give other noncommercial devs a free pass for the sake of solidarity.  When a business makes money, the devs they rely on should make money, too.  That's the principle here, whether the money is made selling commercial-use licenses or some other way.  But nobody's getting paid if we gum up the works of software reuse with preemptive license negotiations.

Again, the direct route is clear.  Stop using fear of GPL as a proxy for being a big company that should pay. If the point is those making bank should pay their library, framework, and tool makers, define "making bank" and put it in the license terms.  For a commercial-licensing project, the terms in the `LICENSE` file say who can use for free, so we need to define the inverse---not making bank, otherwise known as being a small business---and include them with noncommercial users.

That's the [Big Time license](https://bigtimelicense.com).

Independent developer looking to bootstrap a software project finds a great library.  The project sells commercial licenses, but licenses small-business for free, along with noncommercial users, under the Big Time license.  Indie dev _can_ use the library without asking permission or buying a license.  They can adopt the same license terms---noncommercial free, small-business free, big-business paid---for their own project.  They can sell commercial-use licenses, and that is very much a commercial enterprise.  But they don't have to buy a license for the library until they're no longer small anymore.  Perhaps they reach $1m in revenue.  Perhaps they raise $1m in venture capital.  Big Time assures them they'll be able to get a license, and on fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory terms---no exploiting lock-in, based on them adopting when use was free.

This transforms the social experience of commercial licensing.  Dealing with terms and handing over payment ceases to be a blocker.  It becomes part of the celebration.  There may be a negotiation, but the overall effect is more like a royalty than permission to try in the first place.  Pay when paid, not pay upfront.
